# Methods for Determining Rate Laws from Experimental Data

In the previous chapter, we derived integrated rate laws for zeroth-, first-, and second-order reactions and saw that each gives a different functional form for concentration as a function of time. We also saw that by plotting data in the appropriate linear form, we can test whether a given rate law is consistent with our measurements. But how do we carry out this analysis systematically? And what do we do when a reaction involves more than one reactant? In this chapter, we develop four complementary methods for determining rate laws from experimental data.

## The Integral Method

The integral method applies the graphical analysis we introduced in the previous chapter as a systematic procedure. Given concentration–time data for a reaction, we plot the data in each of the linear forms from the summary table (reproduced below for convenience) and look for the plot that gives a straight line. The order of that straight-line plot tells us the reaction order; the slope gives the rate constant.

| Order | Linear plot | Slope |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 0 | $[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 1 | $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 2 | $1/[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $+k$ |

### Worked Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited

Returning to the azomethane decomposition data from the previous chapter, we now apply the integral method systematically. Recall the data:

| $t$ / min | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $[\text{azomethane}]$ / $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | 8.70 | 6.52 | 4.89 | 3.67 | 2.75 | 2.06 | 1.55 |

In the previous chapter, we plotted $\ln[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ and found a straight line with slope $-k = -9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, consistent with first-order kinetics. But to be rigorous, we should also check that the data are *not* consistent with the other candidate rate laws. Plotting $1/[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ gives a curve, not a straight line—ruling out second-order kinetics.

```{r azomethane-second-order-rejection, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Testing the azomethane data against second-order kinetics. Plotting $1/[\\mathrm{azomethane}]$ versus time does not give a straight line, ruling out a second-order rate law.", out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_3/figures/azomethane_second_order_rejection.png")
```

This is the essence of the integral method: we test each candidate rate law in turn and reject those that do not give a straight line. A linear plot both confirms the reaction order and provides the rate constant from the slope.

#### Aside: Modern Analysis Methods {-}

While we have focused on linear transformations, modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original (non-linearised) form. The linear analysis method remains the standard approach in most textbooks, however, and has the practical advantage that it can be applied with nothing more than graph paper and a ruler—or in an exam.

## The Half-Life Method

The half-life method provides a way to test for first-order kinetics without plotting a graph. It exploits a unique property of exponential functions: first-order kinetics gives exponential decay, and for an exponential decay the concentration always decreases by the same *fraction* in equal time intervals. If the concentration drops to 75% of its value in the first 30 minutes, it drops to 75% again in the next 30 minutes, and the next, regardless of the actual concentration. No other functional form has this property.

### Deriving the Half-Life

Recall from the previous chapter that for a first-order reaction:

$$[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}$$

The **half-life** ($t_{1/2}$) is the time taken for the concentration to fall to half its initial value. Setting $[\mathrm{A}]_t = \frac{1}{2}[\mathrm{A}]_0$:

$$\frac{1}{2}[\mathrm{A}]_0 = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}$$

$$\frac{1}{2} = \mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\begin{equation}
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}
(\#eq:first-order-half-life)
\end{equation}

Notice that $t_{1/2}$ depends only on $k$, not on $[\mathrm{A}]_0$. The half-life is *constant*: it takes the same amount of time for the concentration to halve whether we start from $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ or from any later concentration. This is a defining characteristic of first-order kinetics.

### Generalisation: Constant Proportional Change

There is nothing special about the factor of one-half. For a first-order reaction, the time taken for the concentration to fall to any fixed fraction $1/n$ of its starting value is constant:

\begin{equation}
t_{1/n} = \frac{\ln n}{k}
(\#eq:first-order-t1n)
\end{equation}

This follows because exponential decay means the concentration decreases by the same *proportion* in each successive time interval of equal length. If the concentration falls by a factor of 0.75 in the first 30 minutes, it falls by a factor of 0.75 in the next 30 minutes, and the next, and so on. Any constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics.

### Worked Example: Azomethane Revisited

We can use this as an independent check on the azomethane data. Looking at the ratio of successive concentrations, each measured at 30-minute intervals:

| Interval | $[\text{azomethane}]_\text{start}$ | $[\text{azomethane}]_\text{end}$ | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–30 min | 8.70 | 6.52 | 0.75 |
| 30–60 min | 6.52 | 4.89 | 0.75 |
| 60–90 min | 4.89 | 3.67 | 0.75 |
| 90–120 min | 3.67 | 2.75 | 0.75 |
| 120–150 min | 2.75 | 2.06 | 0.75 |
| 150–180 min | 2.06 | 1.55 | 0.75 |

The constant ratio of 0.75 confirms first-order kinetics—without plotting a single graph. From Eqn. \@ref(eq:first-order-t1n) with $n = 1/0.75 = 4/3$ and $\Delta t = 30\,\mathrm{min}$:

$$k = \frac{\ln(4/3)}{30\,\mathrm{min}} = 9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$

This agrees with the value obtained from the integral method, as it should — both methods assume first-order kinetics and extract $k$ from the same underlying exponential. The half-life method is less precise than the graphical method (it relies on reading individual data points rather than fitting a line through all the data), but it provides a quick and intuitive test that does not require plotting.

## The Isolation Method

The integral and half-life methods work well for reactions involving a single reactant, but many reactions involve two or more species. Consider a reaction $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \text{products}$ with rate law:

$$\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]^\beta$$

The rate depends on both $[\mathrm{A}]$ and $[\mathrm{B}]$, which both change with time. How can we determine the partial orders $\alpha$ and $\beta$ separately?

The **isolation method** simplifies the problem by making all but one reactant effectively constant. If we use B in large excess ($[\mathrm{B}]_0 \gg [\mathrm{A}]_0$), then B is consumed in negligible proportion during the reaction and $[\mathrm{B}]_t \approx [\mathrm{B}]_0$ throughout. The rate law becomes:

$$\nu = k'[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha \quad \text{where } k' = k[\mathrm{B}]_0^\beta$$

The reaction now behaves as if it depends only on $[\mathrm{A}]$, with a pseudo-rate constant $k'$ that absorbs the (constant) concentration of B — a **pseudo-$\alpha$th-order** rate law. In the previous chapter, we saw the specific case where $\alpha = 1$, which gives pseudo-first-order kinetics. We can now apply the integral method or half-life method to determine $\alpha$.

To find $\beta$, we repeat the experiment with A in large excess ($[\mathrm{A}]_0 \gg [\mathrm{B}]_0$). Now $[\mathrm{A}]_t \approx [\mathrm{A}]_0$ and:

$$\nu = k''[\mathrm{B}]^\beta \quad \text{where } k'' = k[\mathrm{A}]_0^\alpha$$

Applying the integral method to this simplified rate law gives $\beta$.

### Extracting the True Rate Constant

The isolation method also provides a route to the true rate constant $k$. Taking logarithms of $k' = k[\mathrm{B}]_0^\beta$:

$$\ln k' = \ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$$

By repeating the experiment at several different values of $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ (each still in large excess over $[\mathrm{A}]_0$), we obtain a set of pseudo-rate constants $k'$. A plot of $\ln k'$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ gives a straight line with slope $\beta$ and intercept $\ln k$.

::: {.skill}
**You should be able to:** Explain how the isolation method simplifies a multi-reactant rate law, and use the relationship $\ln k' = \ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ to determine a partial order from pseudo-rate constants.
:::

## The Differential Method (Initial Rates)

The methods above all work with concentration–time data collected over the full course of a reaction. The **differential method** takes a different approach: it works directly with *rates* rather than concentrations. Starting from a general rate law:

$$\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]^\beta$$

taking logarithms gives:

$$\ln\nu = \ln k + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}] + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]$$

If we could measure the rate $\nu$ at known concentrations of A and B, we could determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$ directly. But rate is an instantaneous quantity—how do we measure it?

The practical solution is to use **initial rates**. At $t = 0$, we know the concentrations exactly (they are just the starting concentrations we prepared), and we can estimate the initial rate $\nu_0$ from the initial slope of the concentration–time curve. This gives:

$$\ln\nu_0 = \ln k + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0 + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$$

If we hold $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ constant and vary $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ across a series of experiments, the $\beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ term is the same in every experiment, and we can write:

$$\ln\nu_0 = (\ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0) + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$$

A plot of $\ln\nu_0$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$ gives a straight line with slope $\alpha$. Repeating with $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ held constant and $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ varied gives $\beta$ in the same way.

## Key Concepts

- The **integral method** tests candidate rate laws by plotting concentration–time data in different linear forms. A straight line confirms the proposed order; a curve rules it out. The slope gives the rate constant.
- The **half-life** for a first-order reaction is $t_{1/2} = \ln 2/k$, independent of initial concentration. More generally, constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics.
- The **isolation method** simplifies multi-reactant kinetics by using one reactant in large excess, reducing the rate law to a pseudo-order form in the remaining reactant.
- Repeating isolation experiments at different excess concentrations and plotting $\ln k'$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ determines both the partial order $\beta$ and the true rate constant $k$.
- The **differential method** (initial rates) determines reaction orders by measuring $\nu_0$ at different starting concentrations. A plot of $\ln\nu_0$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$ (at constant $[\mathrm{B}]_0$) gives slope $\alpha$.
- These four methods are complementary: the integral and half-life methods work best for single-reactant systems, while the isolation and differential methods handle multi-reactant systems.
