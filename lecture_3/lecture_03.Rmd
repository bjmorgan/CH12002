# Methods for Determining Rate Laws from Experimental Data

In the previous chapter, we derived integrated rate laws for zeroth-, first-, and second-order reactions and saw that each gives a different functional form for concentration as a function of time. We also saw that by plotting data in the appropriate linear form, we can test whether a given rate law is consistent with our measurements. But how do we carry out this analysis systematically? And what do we do when a reaction involves more than one reactant? In this chapter, we develop four complementary methods for determining rate laws from experimental data.

## The Integral Method

The integral method applies the graphical analysis we introduced in the previous chapter as a systematic procedure. Given concentration–time data for a reaction, we plot the data in each of the linear forms from the summary table (reproduced below for convenience) and look for the plot that gives a straight line. The order of that straight-line plot tells us the reaction order; the slope gives the rate constant.

| Order | Linear plot | Slope |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 0 | $[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 1 | $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 2 | $1/[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $+k$ |

### Worked Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited

Returning to the azomethane decomposition data from the previous chapter, we now apply the integral method systematically. Recall the data:

| $t$ / min | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $[\text{azomethane}]$ / $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | 8.70 | 6.52 | 4.89 | 3.67 | 2.75 | 2.06 | 1.55 |

In the previous chapter, we plotted $\ln[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ and found a straight line with slope $-k = -9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, consistent with first-order kinetics. But to be rigorous, we should also check that the data are *not* consistent with the other candidate rate laws. Plotting $1/[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ gives a curve, not a straight line—ruling out second-order kinetics.

```{r azomethane-second-order-rejection, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Testing the azomethane data against second-order kinetics. Plotting $1/[\\mathrm{azomethane}]$ versus time does not give a straight line, ruling out a second-order rate law.", out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_3/figures/azomethane_second_order_rejection.png")
```

This is the essence of the integral method: we test each candidate rate law in turn and reject those that do not give a straight line. A linear plot both confirms the reaction order and provides the rate constant from the slope.

#### Aside: Modern Analysis Methods {-}

While we have focused on linear transformations, modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original (non-linearised) form. The linear analysis method remains the standard approach in most textbooks, however, and has the practical advantage that it can be applied with nothing more than graph paper and a ruler—or in an exam.

## The Half-Life Method

The half-life method provides a way to test for first-order kinetics without plotting a graph. It exploits a unique property of exponential functions that is worth understanding before we define the half-life itself.

### A Special Property of Exponential Decay

Recall from the previous chapter that for a first-order reaction:

$$[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}$$

What does this exponential decay actually look like? Consider the ratio of the concentration at two times separated by a fixed interval $\Delta t$:

$$\frac{[\mathrm{A}]_{t+\Delta t}}{[\mathrm{A}]_t} = \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-k(t+\Delta t)}}{[\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}} = \mathrm{e}^{-k\Delta t}$$

The initial concentration $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ cancels, and so does $t$ itself. The ratio depends only on $k$ and $\Delta t$ — not on when we start measuring or how much reactant remains. This means that in every time interval of the same length, the concentration decreases by the same *fraction*. If the concentration halves in the first 10 seconds, it halves again in the next 10 seconds, and the next, regardless of the actual concentration. No other functional form has this property — constant proportional change over equal time intervals is the signature of an exponential, and therefore of first-order kinetics.

### Deriving the Half-Life

The **half-life** ($t_{1/2}$) is the time taken for the concentration to fall to half its initial value. Setting $[\mathrm{A}]_t = \frac{1}{2}[\mathrm{A}]_0$:

$$\frac{1}{2}[\mathrm{A}]_0 = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}$$

$$\frac{1}{2} = \mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\begin{equation}
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}
(\#eq:first-order-half-life)
\end{equation}

Notice that $t_{1/2}$ depends only on $k$, not on $[\mathrm{A}]_0$. The half-life is *constant*: it takes the same amount of time for the concentration to halve whether we start from $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ or from any later concentration. This is a defining characteristic of first-order kinetics.

### Generalisation: Constant Proportional Change

There is nothing special about the factor of one-half. For a first-order reaction, the time taken for the concentration to fall to any fixed fraction $1/n$ of its starting value is constant:

\begin{equation}
t_{1/n} = \frac{\ln n}{k}
(\#eq:first-order-t1n)
\end{equation}

This follows because exponential decay means the concentration decreases by the same *proportion* in each successive time interval of equal length. If the concentration falls by a factor of 0.75 in the first 30 minutes, it falls by a factor of 0.75 in the next 30 minutes, and the next, and so on. Any constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics.

### Worked Example: Azomethane Revisited

We can use this as an independent check on the azomethane data. Looking at the ratio of successive concentrations, each measured at 30-minute intervals:

| Interval | $[\text{azomethane}]_\text{start}$ | $[\text{azomethane}]_\text{end}$ | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–30 min | 8.70 | 6.52 | 0.75 |
| 30–60 min | 6.52 | 4.89 | 0.75 |
| 60–90 min | 4.89 | 3.67 | 0.75 |
| 90–120 min | 3.67 | 2.75 | 0.75 |
| 120–150 min | 2.75 | 2.06 | 0.75 |
| 150–180 min | 2.06 | 1.55 | 0.75 |

The constant ratio of 0.75 confirms first-order kinetics—without plotting a single graph. From Eqn. \@ref(eq:first-order-t1n) with $n = 1/0.75 = 4/3$ and $\Delta t = 30\,\mathrm{min}$:

$$k = \frac{\ln(4/3)}{30\,\mathrm{min}} = 9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$

This agrees with the value obtained from the integral method, as it should — both methods assume first-order kinetics and extract $k$ from the same underlying exponential. The half-life method is less precise than the graphical method (it relies on reading individual data points rather than fitting a line through all the data), but it provides a quick and intuitive test that does not require plotting.

**You should be able to:** Derive the first-order half-life expression $t_{1/2} = \ln 2/k$, and use constant proportional change in concentration–time data to test for first-order kinetics.

## The Isolation Method

The integral and half-life methods work well for reactions involving a single reactant, but many reactions involve two or more species. Consider a reaction $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \text{products}$ with rate law:

$$\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]^\beta$$

The rate depends on both $[\mathrm{A}]$ and $[\mathrm{B}]$, which both change with time. How can we determine the partial orders $\alpha$ and $\beta$ separately?

We cannot simply apply the integral method here. For a single-reactant system, we could write a differential equation in one variable and integrate it. With two reactants, both concentrations change simultaneously, and the resulting differential equation generally cannot be solved analytically. Even in the special cases where an analytical solution exists, we do not know $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in advance — so we would not know which solution to try. We need a different approach.

The **isolation method** sidesteps the problem by turning a two-variable system back into a one-variable system. The idea is to make all but one reactant effectively constant. If we use B in large excess — say $[\mathrm{B}]_0 = 1.000\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ and $[\mathrm{A}]_0 = 0.010\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ — then even after A is completely consumed, B has only dropped from $1.000$ to $0.990\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$: a change of just 1%. For all practical purposes, $[\mathrm{B}]$ has not changed. We can therefore write $[\mathrm{B}]_t \approx [\mathrm{B}]_0$ throughout the reaction, and the rate law becomes:

$$\nu = k'[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha \quad \text{where } k' = k[\mathrm{B}]_0^\beta$$

The reaction now behaves as if it depends only on $[\mathrm{A}]$, with a pseudo-rate constant $k'$ that absorbs the (constant) concentration of B — a **pseudo-$\alpha$th-order** rate law. In the previous chapter, we saw the specific case where $\alpha = 1$, which gives pseudo-first-order kinetics. We can now apply the integral method or half-life method to determine $\alpha$.

To find $\beta$, we repeat the experiment with A in large excess ($[\mathrm{A}]_0 \gg [\mathrm{B}]_0$). Now $[\mathrm{A}]_t \approx [\mathrm{A}]_0$ and:

$$\nu = k''[\mathrm{B}]^\beta \quad \text{where } k'' = k[\mathrm{A}]_0^\alpha$$

Applying the integral method to this simplified rate law gives $\beta$.

### Extracting the True Rate Constant

The isolation method also provides a route to the true rate constant $k$. Taking logarithms of $k' = k[\mathrm{B}]_0^\beta$:

$$\ln k' = \ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$$

By repeating the experiment at several different values of $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ (each still in large excess over $[\mathrm{A}]_0$), we obtain a set of pseudo-rate constants $k'$. A plot of $\ln k'$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ gives a straight line with slope $\beta$ and intercept $\ln k$.

::: {.skill}
**You should be able to:** Explain how the isolation method simplifies a multi-reactant rate law, and use the relationship $\ln k' = \ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ to determine a partial order from pseudo-rate constants.
:::

## The Differential Method (Initial Rates)

The methods above all work with concentration–time data collected over the full course of a reaction. The **differential method** takes a different approach: it works directly with *rates* rather than concentrations. Starting from a general rate law:

$$\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]^\beta$$

taking logarithms gives:

$$\ln\nu = \ln k + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}] + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]$$

If we could measure the rate $\nu$ at known concentrations of A and B, we could determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$ directly. But rate is an instantaneous quantity—how do we measure it?

The practical solution is to use **initial rates**. At $t = 0$, we know the concentrations exactly (they are just the starting concentrations we prepared), and we can estimate the initial rate $\nu_0$ from the initial slope of the concentration–time curve. This gives:

$$\ln\nu_0 = \ln k + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0 + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$$

If we hold $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ constant and vary $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ across a series of experiments, the $\beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ term is the same in every experiment, and we can write:

$$\ln\nu_0 = (\ln k + \beta\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0) + \alpha\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$$

A plot of $\ln\nu_0$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$ gives a straight line with slope $\alpha$. Repeating with $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ held constant and $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ varied gives $\beta$ in the same way.

### Worked Example: Determining Orders by Comparing Experiments

In practice, when starting concentrations are chosen as simple multiples, we can often determine orders by direct comparison rather than plotting. Consider the following data for $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \text{products}$:

| Experiment | $[\mathrm{A}]_0\,/\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | $[\mathrm{B}]_0\,/\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | $\nu_0\,/\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 0.10 | 0.10 | $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ |
| 2 | 0.20 | 0.10 | $2.4 \times 10^{-3}$ |
| 3 | 0.10 | 0.20 | $4.8 \times 10^{-3}$ |

**Finding $\alpha$:** Comparing experiments 1 and 2, $[\mathrm{B}]_0$ is the same, so the $[\mathrm{B}]_0^\beta$ terms cancel when we take the ratio of rates:

$$\frac{\nu_{0,2}}{\nu_{0,1}} = \frac{k[\mathrm{A}]_{0,2}^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]_{0,2}^\beta}{k[\mathrm{A}]_{0,1}^\alpha[\mathrm{B}]_{0,1}^\beta} = \left(\frac{[\mathrm{A}]_{0,2}}{[\mathrm{A}]_{0,1}}\right)^\alpha = \left(\frac{0.20}{0.10}\right)^\alpha = 2^\alpha$$

The measured ratio is $\nu_{0,2}/\nu_{0,1} = 2.4 \times 10^{-3}/1.2 \times 10^{-3} = 2$. So $2^\alpha = 2$, giving $\alpha = 1$: first order in A.

**Finding $\beta$:** Comparing experiments 1 and 3, $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ is the same:

$$\frac{\nu_{0,3}}{\nu_{0,1}} = \left(\frac{[\mathrm{B}]_{0,3}}{[\mathrm{B}]_{0,1}}\right)^\beta = \left(\frac{0.20}{0.10}\right)^\beta = 2^\beta$$

The measured ratio is $4.8 \times 10^{-3}/1.2 \times 10^{-3} = 4$. So $2^\beta = 4$, giving $\beta = 2$: second order in B.

The rate law is therefore $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]^2$. The underlying logic is the same as for the graphical method — we are changing one concentration at a time and seeing how the rate responds — but the comparison is immediate and does not require plotting. Notice that this is the same principle behind the isolation method: **control one variable, change the other, and see what happens**. In the isolation method we achieve this by flooding the system with excess of one reactant; here we achieve it by experimental design, choosing starting concentrations that differ in only one component.

**You should be able to:** Use the method of initial rates to determine reaction orders, either by comparing pairs of experiments (the ratio method) or by plotting $\ln\nu_0$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$.

## Key Concepts

- The **integral method** tests candidate rate laws by plotting concentration–time data in different linear forms. A straight line confirms the proposed order; a curve rules it out. The slope gives the rate constant.
- **Exponential decay** (first-order kinetics) has a unique signature: the concentration decreases by the same fraction in equal time intervals. This follows because the ratio $[\mathrm{A}]_{t+\Delta t}/[\mathrm{A}]_t = \mathrm{e}^{-k\Delta t}$ depends only on $k$ and $\Delta t$, not on the concentration itself.
- The **half-life** for a first-order reaction is $t_{1/2} = \ln 2/k$, independent of initial concentration. Constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics.
- The **isolation method** simplifies multi-reactant kinetics by using one reactant in large excess, reducing the rate law to a pseudo-order form in the remaining reactant. This works because the excess reactant is consumed in negligible proportion during the reaction.
- Repeating isolation experiments at different excess concentrations and plotting $\ln k'$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{B}]_0$ determines both the partial order $\beta$ and the true rate constant $k$.
- The **method of initial rates** determines reaction orders by measuring $\nu_0$ at different starting concentrations. Orders can be found by comparing pairs of experiments (the ratio method) or by plotting $\ln\nu_0$ versus $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$ (at constant $[\mathrm{B}]_0$) and reading the slope.
- All four methods rest on the same principle: **change one variable at a time**. The integral and half-life methods apply to single-reactant systems. For multi-reactant systems, the isolation method achieves single-variable behaviour by flooding with excess, while the method of initial rates achieves it by experimental design.
