# Feedback, Stability, and Explosions

In the previous chapter, we saw that chain reactions can be classified as straight or branching depending on whether propagation conserves or multiplies the number of reactive intermediates. We now ask the quantitative question: *what determines whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or explodes?* The answer lies in a simple differential equation whose behaviour is controlled by a single parameter — the **feedback parameter** $\phi$.

## The General Feedback Equation {#sec:feedback-equation}

Consider a reactive intermediate I that is produced by initiation and whose concentration changes through two competing effects:

1. **Initiation** creates new intermediates at a constant rate $\nu_f = k_\mathrm{init}[\mathrm{M}]$, independent of $[\mathrm{I}]$.
2. **Propagation and termination** together cause $[\mathrm{I}]$ to grow or decay at a rate proportional to $[\mathrm{I}]$ itself.

The rate equation for I is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{I}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = \nu_f + \phi[\mathrm{I}]
(\#eq:feedback-equation)
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the **feedback parameter** that captures the net effect of all processes that depend on the intermediate concentration. The sign of $\phi$ determines everything.

### What Determines $\phi$?

The feedback parameter $\phi$ reflects the competition between processes that *create* intermediates and processes that *remove* them:

**For a straight chain reaction** (e.g. H~2~ + Br~2~), the propagation steps conserve the number of intermediates — every radical consumed produces exactly one new radical. The net effect on $[\mathrm{I}]$ comes only from termination, which removes intermediates:

$$\phi = -k_\mathrm{term}$$

Since $k_\mathrm{term} > 0$, the feedback parameter is *negative*. Termination acts as a brake: the faster the intermediates build up, the faster they are removed by recombination.

**For a branching chain reaction** (e.g. H~2~/O~2~ combustion), the propagation steps multiply intermediates. Each propagation cycle creates new radicals at a rate proportional to $[\mathrm{I}]$, competing with termination:

$$\phi = k_\mathrm{branch} - k_\mathrm{term}$$

Now the sign of $\phi$ depends on which process wins. If termination dominates ($k_\mathrm{term} > k_\mathrm{branch}$), then $\phi < 0$ and the system behaves like a straight chain — it reaches a steady state. If branching dominates ($k_\mathrm{branch} > k_\mathrm{term}$), then $\phi > 0$ and the intermediate concentration grows without bound.

## Solving the Feedback Equation {#sec:feedback-solution}

Eqn. \@ref(eq:feedback-equation) is a first-order linear ODE that we can solve by separation of variables. With the initial condition $[\mathrm{I}]_0 = 0$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{I}]}{\nu_f + \phi[\mathrm{I}]} = \mathrm{d}t$$

Integrating both sides:

$$\frac{1}{\phi}\ln\left(\frac{\nu_f + \phi[\mathrm{I}]_t}{\nu_f}\right) = t$$

Rearranging:

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{I}]_t = \frac{\nu_f}{\phi}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\phi t} - 1\right)
(\#eq:feedback-solution)
\end{equation}

This single equation describes both stable and explosive behaviour, depending entirely on the sign of $\phi$.

### Negative Feedback ($\phi < 0$): Steady State

When $\phi < 0$, the exponential term $\mathrm{e}^{\phi t}$ decays to zero as $t \rightarrow \infty$. The intermediate concentration approaches a constant value:

$$[\mathrm{I}]_\infty = \frac{\nu_f}{|\phi|}$$

This is a **steady state**: the rate of initiation is exactly balanced by the rate of termination. The system is self-regulating — if $[\mathrm{I}]$ rises above the steady-state value, the increased termination rate pulls it back down. This is the scenario that underpins the steady-state approximation we have used throughout the course.

The time to reach the steady state is characterised by $\tau = 1/|\phi|$. If $|\phi|$ is large (fast termination), the steady state is reached quickly and persists for most of the reaction — exactly the conditions under which the SSA is valid.

### Positive Feedback ($\phi > 0$): Explosion

When $\phi > 0$, the exponential term $\mathrm{e}^{\phi t}$ grows without bound. The intermediate concentration increases exponentially:

$$[\mathrm{I}]_t \approx \frac{\nu_f}{\phi}\,\mathrm{e}^{\phi t} \qquad \text{(for large } t\text{)}$$

Branching creates intermediates faster than termination can remove them. Each new radical generates more than one replacement, leading to a cascade. The radical population — and hence the reaction rate — increases exponentially. This is a **chain-branching explosion**: the reaction accelerates catastrophically until limited by reactant depletion or physical containment.

When $\\phi < 0$, $[\\mathrm{I}]$ rises to a steady state $\\nu_f/|\\phi|$ (lower curve).

## From Mechanism to Stability {#sec:mechanism-to-stability}

We can now connect the abstract feedback parameter $\phi$ to the elementary steps of a specific mechanism. Consider a general chain reaction with initiation, propagation, branching, and termination:

**Initiation:** $\mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_\mathrm{init}} \mathrm{I}$ (rate $= k_\mathrm{init}[\mathrm{M}] = \nu_f$)

**Propagation (straight):** $\mathrm{I} + \mathrm{A} \xrightarrow{k_\mathrm{prop}} \mathrm{I} + \text{products}$ (no net change in [I])

**Branching:** $\mathrm{I} + \mathrm{A} \xrightarrow{k_\mathrm{branch}} 2\mathrm{I} + \text{products}$ (net gain of one I)

**Termination:** $\mathrm{I} \xrightarrow{k_\mathrm{term}} \text{inactive products}$ (net loss of one I)

The rate equation for I is:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{I}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = \underbrace{\nu_f}_{\text{initiation}} + \underbrace{k_\mathrm{branch}[\mathrm{A}]}_{\text{branching}} \cdot [\mathrm{I}] - \underbrace{k_\mathrm{term}}_{\text{termination}} \cdot [\mathrm{I}]$$

This has the form of Eqn. \@ref(eq:feedback-equation) with:

\begin{equation}
\phi = k_\mathrm{branch}[\mathrm{A}] - k_\mathrm{term}
(\#eq:phi-general)
\end{equation}

This expression reveals why conditions matter:

- **Concentration dependence.** If the branching step involves a reactant A, then $\phi$ depends on $[\mathrm{A}]$. A dilute mixture may have $\phi < 0$ (safe), while a concentrated mixture has $\phi > 0$ (explosive). This is why fuel–air mixtures explode only above a certain concentration.

- **Pressure dependence.** In gas-phase reactions, termination often occurs at surfaces (vessel walls), while branching occurs in the gas phase. Changing the pressure alters the balance: at low pressure, molecules reach the walls easily and $k_\mathrm{term}$ is large (safe); at intermediate pressures, gas-phase branching may dominate (explosive); at very high pressures, three-body termination in the gas phase becomes important and the system may become safe again.

- **Temperature dependence.** The rate constants $k_\mathrm{branch}$ and $k_\mathrm{term}$ have different activation energies. Raising the temperature may push $\phi$ from negative to positive, triggering an explosion.

These considerations explain why hydrogen–oxygen mixtures have complex **explosion limits** — boundaries in pressure–temperature space that separate explosive from non-explosive conditions. The limits correspond to the condition $\phi = 0$, where branching and termination are exactly balanced.

```{r explosion-limits, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic explosion limits for the H$_2$/O$_2$ system in pressure--temperature space. The boundaries correspond to $\\phi = 0$, where branching and termination rates are balanced. The system is explosive in the shaded region and reaches a steady state outside it."}

## Key Concepts

- The **feedback equation** $\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{I}]/\mathrm{d}t = \nu_f + \phi[\mathrm{I}]$ describes the evolution of reactive intermediates in chain reactions. The initiation rate $\nu_f$ creates intermediates; the feedback parameter $\phi$ determines whether they accumulate or are controlled.
- For **straight chains**, $\phi = -k_\mathrm{term} < 0$: termination provides negative feedback and the system reaches a steady state.
- For **branching chains**, $\phi = k_\mathrm{branch}[\mathrm{A}] - k_\mathrm{term}$: the sign depends on the competition between branching (which multiplies intermediates) and termination (which removes them).
- The general solution $[\mathrm{I}]_t = (\nu_f/\phi)(\mathrm{e}^{\phi t} - 1)$ describes both steady-state behaviour ($\phi < 0$) and explosive runaway ($\phi > 0$) within a single equation.
- **Explosion limits** correspond to the condition $\phi = 0$. They depend on concentration, pressure, and temperature because these variables affect the rates of branching and termination differently.
- The SSA is valid precisely when $\phi < 0$ and $|\phi|$ is large — the intermediate reaches its steady state quickly and stays there. Positive feedback ($\phi > 0$) represents the breakdown of the SSA.
