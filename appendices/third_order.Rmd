# Why Aren't All Bimolecular Reactions Third Order?

## An Apparent Contradiction in Reaction Kinetics

The formation of ozone follows an unusual kinetic pattern:

$$\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O_2} + \mathrm{M} \rightarrow \mathrm{O_3} + \mathrm{M}$$

Despite appearing to be a simple combination of an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule, this reaction exhibits third-order kinetics, requiring the involvement of a third body (M). This raises an important question: if the reaction between O and O~2~ cannot proceed without a third body, why do we observe countless other bimolecular gas-phase reactions that follow simple second-order kinetics?

The laws of physics—conservation of energy and momentum—apply universally to all molecular collisions. If these constraints prevent a simple O + O~2~ reaction, they should theoretically create similar challenges for other bimolecular reactions. Understanding why this isn't the case requires examining the molecular-level details of different reaction types.

## The Ozone Formation Challenge

When an oxygen atom collides with an oxygen molecule, forming a new O-O bond releases approximately 107 kJ/mol of energy. This substantial energy must be accommodated within the newly formed O~3~ molecule.

Conservation of momentum constrains this process. In a head-on collision, momentum conservation dictates that the resulting O~3~ molecule carries the combined momentum of both reactants. This constraint directs much of the released energy into vibrational modes of the O~3~ molecule rather than allowing it to dissipate as translational energy.

CAPTION: Figure 2: Momentum conservation in O + O₂ collision. When an oxygen atom collides with an oxygen molecule, momentum conservation constrains how the released energy (107 kJ/mol) can be distributed, directing it predominantly into vibrational modes of the newly formed bond.
-->

With only three atoms, ozone has just three vibrational modes available to absorb this energy. Consequently, the newly formed bond becomes so vibrationally excited that it exceeds its own dissociation energy—the molecule would break apart again without some mechanism to remove this excess energy.

<!--

- Asymmetric stretch (one bond extending while the other contracts)

CAPTION: Figure 3: The three vibrational modes of ozone. As a non-linear triatomic molecule, ozone has only three ways to store vibrational energy: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. This limited number of modes means energy cannot be widely distributed within the molecule.
-->

The third body (M) provides the necessary solution. When it collides with the vibrationally excited O~3~*, it can carry away excess energy as translational motion, allowing the ozone molecule to stabilize.

## Why Most Bimolecular Reactions Don't Require a Third Body

Given that momentum and energy conservation apply universally, one might expect all bimolecular reactions to require third bodies. This would mean we should never observe simple second-order kinetics for any gas-phase bimolecular reaction. Yet such reactions are common.

Several key factors allow most bimolecular reactions to proceed without third-body intervention:

### Activation Barriers: Redirecting Energy Flow

Most chemical reactions feature an activation energy barrier, creating a transition state that must be traversed before products form. This feature plays a crucial role in energy redistribution.

<!--
FIGURE 5: Reaction Coordinate Diagrams - Barrier vs. Barrierless
A side-by-side comparison of reaction coordinate diagrams:
LEFT: Barrierless reaction (O + O₂ → O₃) showing direct downhill path to products
RIGHT: Reaction with barrier showing clear activation energy hill with transition state at the top
Both diagrams should show potential energy on vertical axis, reaction coordinate on horizontal axis
CAPTION: Figure 5: Comparison of reaction coordinate diagrams. Left: A barrierless reaction (like O + O₂ → O₃) proceeds directly downhill to products, providing no mechanism to redirect energy flow. Right: A reaction with an activation barrier forces reactants to climb an energy hill and pass through a transition state before descending to products.
-->

On a potential energy surface, a reaction with a barrier features a saddle point—a mountain pass through which the reaction must proceed. As the system descends from this saddle point toward products, the topography of the energy landscape guides energy into multiple modes of motion.

<!--
FIGURE 6: Potential Energy Surfaces in 2D
A side-by-side comparison of 2D contour maps:
LEFT: Barrierless surface showing contours that lead directly from reactants to products (concentric patterns around product well)
RIGHT: Surface with saddle point showing characteristic mountain pass topology
Both maps should use contour lines to show energy levels, with arrows indicating reaction paths
CAPTION: Figure 6: Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces. Left: A barrierless reaction has a direct path into the product well with no saddle point. Right: A reaction with a barrier features a saddle point topology that constrains the reaction trajectory and redirects energy as the system descends to products.
-->

This descent from a barrier redistributes energy among various degrees of freedom—vibrational, rotational, and translational—preventing excessive concentration in any single vibration. This redistribution often keeps the energy in any single bond below the dissociation threshold.

Ozone formation, being barrierless, lacks this redistribution mechanism. Without a saddle point to navigate, energy remains concentrated along the direct approach coordinate.

### Molecular Complexity: More Storage Compartments for Energy

The capacity of a molecule to absorb energy without dissociating increases with its size and complexity. A non-linear molecule with N atoms has 3N-6 vibrational modes. For ozone (N=3), this means only 3 vibrational modes, offering limited pathways to distribute the reaction energy.

<!--
FIGURE 7: Energy Distribution in Simple vs. Complex Molecules

RIGHT: Complex organic molecule with many atoms, showing same amount of energy widely distributed across numerous vibrational modes

CAPTION: Figure 7: Energy distribution in molecules of different complexity. Left: In a small molecule like ozone (3 atoms), energy becomes concentrated in just three vibrational modes, potentially exceeding bond dissociation energies. Right: In a complex molecule (10+ atoms), the same amount of energy spreads across many vibrational modes, reducing the amount in any single bond.
-->

Consider, by contrast, a reaction forming a molecule with 10 atoms. With 24 vibrational modes available, energy can distribute much more widely, reducing the amount concentrated in any single bond. This spreading of energy decreases the likelihood that any particular bond will receive enough energy to break.

### Exchange Reactions: Energy Balancing Acts

Many bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous bond breaking and formation:

$$\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{BC} \rightarrow \mathrm{AB} + \mathrm{C}$$

In these exchange reactions, energy required to break the BC bond partly offsets energy released by forming the AB bond. This balanced energy flow reduces the net energy that products must accommodate, avoiding the problem of excessive vibrational excitation.

CAPTION: Figure 8: Energy balance in different reaction types. Left: In pure association reactions (like ozone formation), all energy from bond formation must be accommodated by the product. Center: In exchange reactions, energy required to break existing bonds partly offsets energy released by forming new bonds. Right: In endothermic reactions, energy is absorbed rather than released.
-->

The formation of ozone, in contrast, involves pure bond formation with no offsetting bond breaking, creating a significant energy management challenge.

### The Influence of Reaction Barriers on Energy Partitioning

The presence of an activation barrier does more than simply redirect energy—it changes how energy partitions between different molecular motions in the products.

<!--

CAPTION: Figure 9: Energy partitioning in barrierless vs. barrier-crossing reactions. Top: In a barrierless reaction, energy predominantly enters vibrational modes of the newly formed bond. Bottom: When descending from a transition state, energy distributes across vibrational, rotational, and translational modes due to the topography of the potential energy surface.
-->

In barrierless reactions like ozone formation, momentum conservation in the direct approach directs energy predominantly into vibration along the bond-forming coordinate. The system lacks any mechanism to redirect this energy flow.

For reactions with barriers, the descent from the transition state involves a trajectory along multiple coordinates. The saddle point geometry creates couplings between different molecular motions, directing energy into rotational and translational modes rather than concentrating it in vibration.

This energy partitioning explains why many exothermic reactions with barriers can proceed without third-body stabilization despite releasing considerable energy.

## A Spectrum of Behavior

Rather than a strict division between reactions that do or don't require third bodies, chemical reactions exhibit a spectrum of behaviors. The likelihood of requiring third-body stabilization increases with:

- Decreasing activation barrier height
- Increasing reaction exothermicity
- Decreasing molecular complexity
- Pure association rather than exchange character

<!--

CAPTION: Figure 10: Spectrum of third-body requirements across different reaction types. The need for third-body stabilization increases toward the top left (barrierless, highly exothermic reactions forming simple molecules) and decreases toward the bottom right (reactions with barriers, moderate energy release, and complex products).
-->

The ozone formation reaction represents an extreme case along this spectrum—a highly exothermic, barrierless association reaction forming a small molecule. These combined factors create conditions requiring third-body intervention.

Most bimolecular reactions we typically study feature some combination of activation barriers, moderate energy release, greater molecular complexity, or exchange character that allows them to manage reaction energy without third-body assistance.

## Conclusions

The observation that some reactions require third bodies while others don't is explained by examining how energy distributes during molecular collisions. The physical principles of energy and momentum conservation apply universally, but their consequences vary based on reaction energetics, molecular structure, and reaction mechanism.

The existence of simple second-order kinetics for many bimolecular reactions doesn't contradict the principles that make ozone formation require a third body. It reflects the different mechanisms by which chemical systems accommodate and redistribute energy during reactions.

These principles help explain the diverse rate behaviors observed across chemical systems—from atmospheric processes to combustion chemistry to biological transformations.
