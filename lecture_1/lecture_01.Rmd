# Introduction to Chemical Kinetics

## Why Study Reaction Kinetics?

Chemistry is fundamentally concerned with change—the transformation of substances into new forms with different properties. When we mix reactants together, we want to know not just *whether* a reaction will occur, but *how rapidly* it will proceed. While thermodynamics provides powerful tools for determining whether a particular chemical change is favourable and what the final equilibrium composition will be, it tells us nothing about how quickly this equilibrium will be reached.

A reaction may be thermodynamically favourable yet proceed so slowly that it appears not to happen at all. Consider the conversion of diamond to graphite—thermodynamically spontaneous at room temperature and pressure, yet the process occurs at such a negligible rate that diamonds remain stable for geological timescales. Conversely, some reactions reach equilibrium in fractions of a second.

Chemical kinetics addresses these questions of reaction rates and mechanisms. Where thermodynamics concerns itself with the energy relationships that govern chemical equilibria, kinetics focuses on the rates of chemical processes and the molecular pathways by which they occur. Through kinetic analysis, we can determine how quickly reactants transform into products, what factors influence reaction speed, and what sequence of molecular events constitutes the reaction mechanism.

The complementary nature of thermodynamics and kinetics provides a complete picture of chemical change:

- **Thermodynamics** tells us whether a reaction *can* occur and what the equilibrium state will be
- **Kinetics** tells us how *fast* we approach that equilibrium and by what molecular pathway

Both perspectives are essential for understanding chemical processes—in laboratory settings, industrial applications, and natural systems.

## Describing How Concentrations Change with Time

Let us examine a simple reaction: the conversion of a reactant A into a product B:

$$\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{B}$$

```{r fig-concentration-profile, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Time evolution of concentrations for the reaction A → B. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of reactant A decreases while the concentration of product B increases. At any time $t$, the sum of the two concentrations equals the initial concentration of A (assuming we start with pure A).", out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_1/figures/concentration_profile.png")
```


As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations of both species change. We track the progress of the reaction by monitoring concentrations as functions of time. Using square brackets to denote concentration (in mol dm$^{-3}$), we write these time-dependent concentrations as $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ and $[\mathrm{B}]_t$.

Starting from initial values at $t = 0$, the system evolves toward its final state. The questions we might ask include:

- How much product B is present after time $t$?
- How long will it take for a certain percentage of A to convert to B?
- If we change pressure, temperature, or initial concentration, how will the reaction speed be affected?

Answering these questions requires us to understand how reaction rates relate to concentrations—and this is the central concern of chemical kinetics.

## Reaction Rates

We quantify how quickly a reaction occurs in terms of the rate at which concentrations change with time. For our simple A → B reaction, the **reaction rate** can be expressed as either the rate of disappearance of A or the rate of appearance of B. If the rate were constant, calculating it would be straightforward—we would simply measure the change in concentration over a time interval:

$$\text{change in [A] per unit time} = \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_{t_2} - [\mathrm{A}]_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta[\mathrm{A}]}{\Delta t}$$

```{r fig-rate-slope, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The reaction rate at any instant equals the slope of the tangent to the concentration-time curve at that point. For a reaction where the rate decreases over time (as reactant is consumed), the slope becomes less steep as the reaction progresses.", out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_1/figures/rate_slope.png")
```

In most cases, however, reaction rates are not constant—they change as the reaction progresses and reactant concentrations decrease. To capture the instantaneous rate at any moment, we use the derivative:

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = +\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

The negative sign in the first expression ensures that the rate is a positive quantity, since $[\mathrm{A}]$ decreases with time (giving a negative derivative). By convention, reaction rates are always expressed as positive values.

For reactions with more complex stoichiometry, the relationship between concentration changes requires appropriate stoichiometric factors. Consider a reaction where one molecule of A combines with two molecules of B to form one molecule of C:

$$\mathrm{A} + 2\mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{C}$$

```{r fig-stoich-profiles, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Concentration profiles for the reaction A + 2B → C. Species B is consumed twice as fast as A, reflecting the 2:1 stoichiometric ratio. The rate of formation of C equals the rate of consumption of A.", out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_1/figures/stoichiometric_profiles.png")
```

Here, B is consumed twice as rapidly as A. To define a single, unambiguous reaction rate, we include stoichiometric factors:

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = +\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{C}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

In general, for a reaction with stoichiometry

$$\nu_\mathrm{A}\mathrm{A} + \nu_\mathrm{B}\mathrm{B} + \ldots \rightarrow \nu_\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P} + \nu_\mathrm{Q}\mathrm{Q} + \ldots$$

the rate is written as:

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{1}{\nu_\mathrm{A}}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{1}{\nu_\mathrm{B}}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = \ldots = +\frac{1}{\nu_\mathrm{P}}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{P}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = +\frac{1}{\nu_\mathrm{Q}}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{Q}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = \ldots$$

But where do these stoichiometric factors come from? The answer lies in a fundamental principle: the conservation of mass.

## Mass Balance

Chemical reactions cannot create or destroy mass—they merely rearrange atoms into new configurations. This principle of mass conservation provides the foundation for understanding how the rates of change of different species are connected.

Consider our simple reaction A → B. If each molecule of A converts into exactly one molecule of B, then at any time $t$ the total number of molecules (and hence the total concentration) remains constant:

$$[\mathrm{A}]_t + [\mathrm{B}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\mathrm{B}]_0$$

If we start with pure A (so that $[\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0$), this simplifies to:

$$[\mathrm{A}]_t + [\mathrm{B}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0$$

Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to time:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$$

since the initial concentration $[\mathrm{A}]_0$ is a constant. Rearranging:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

This tells us that for this simple reaction, the rate of formation of B exactly equals the rate of consumption of A.

Now consider a reaction where one molecule of A produces two molecules of B:

$$\mathrm{A} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{B}$$

Here, conservation of *mass* does not imply conservation of *moles*—we gain one mole of molecules for every mole of A that reacts. To write a mass balance, we note that each A molecule that reacts produces two B molecules. If we define our "conserved quantity" in terms of B-equivalents, then one A is worth two B, giving:

$$2[\mathrm{A}]_t + [\mathrm{B}]_t = 2[\mathrm{A}]_0$$

Taking the derivative:

$$2\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$$

Rearranging:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -2\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

This confirms that B is produced twice as fast as A is consumed—exactly what we expect from the stoichiometry. To define a single reaction rate that is independent of which species we monitor, we write:

$$\nu = -\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = +\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

For any reaction, mass balance leads to the general expression:

\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{1}{n}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{X}]}{\mathrm{d}t}
(\#eq:rate-stoichiometric)
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species X (negative for reactants, positive for products). This relationship ensures that the reaction rate $\nu$ has the same numerical value regardless of which species we use to measure it.

The units of reaction rate are concentration per unit time: mol dm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$.

## Rate Laws

The rates of chemical reactions typically depend on the concentrations of the reactants. The mathematical relationship between concentrations and rate is called a **rate law**. Many reactions follow a simple rate law where the rate is proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to some power:

\begin{equation}
\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^a[\mathrm{B}]^b[\mathrm{C}]^c \ldots
(\#eq:rate-law-general)
\end{equation}

This expression contains several important quantities. The proportionality factor $k$ is called the **rate constant**; it depends on temperature but not on concentration. The exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, etc. are called the **order** of reaction with respect to reactants A, B, C, etc., and their sum $(a + b + c + \ldots)$ is the **overall reaction order**. Note that orders need not be integers—they can be zero, fractional, or even negative.

An important point: the orders in a rate law need not reflect the stoichiometry of the overall reaction equation. For example:

$$\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{I}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{HI} \qquad \nu = k[\mathrm{H}_2][\mathrm{I}_2]$$

Here the orders (both 1) happen to match the stoichiometric coefficients. But consider:

$$3\mathrm{ClO}^- \rightarrow \mathrm{ClO}_3^- + 2\mathrm{Cl}^- \qquad \nu = k[\mathrm{ClO}^-]^2$$

The stoichiometric coefficient of ClO$^-$ is 3, but the reaction is second order in ClO$^-$.

Some reactions exhibit rate laws that cannot be written in the simple power-law form at all. A classic example is the formation of hydrogen bromide:

$$\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{HBr} \qquad \nu = \frac{k[\mathrm{H}_2][\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1/2}}{1 + k'[\mathrm{HBr}]/[\mathrm{Br}_2]}$$

This reaction is first order with respect to H~2~, but the orders with respect to Br~2~ and HBr are undefined in the usual sense. The appearance of the product HBr in the denominator indicates that the product actually *inhibits* the reaction—a phenomenon we will explore later in the course.

A complex rate law always implies a multistep reaction mechanism.

## Elementary Processes

Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of simple molecular-level steps called **elementary processes** (or elementary reactions). An elementary process represents a single molecular event—a transformation that cannot be broken down further. The **molecularity** of an elementary process describes how many reactant molecules participate in that single step. A **unimolecular** process involves a single molecule undergoing transformation—for example, isomerisation or decomposition. A **bimolecular** process requires two molecules to collide and react. **Termolecular** processes, where three molecules must collide simultaneously, are rare.

```{r fig-molecularity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of elementary processes classified by molecularity. Unimolecular processes involve a single molecule (e.g., isomerisation or decomposition). Bimolecular processes involve collision between two molecules. Termolecular processes, involving simultaneous three-body collisions, are rare.", out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_1/figures/molecularity.png")
```

Termolecular processes are rare because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very low. When apparent third-order kinetics are observed, the mechanism usually involves sequential bimolecular steps rather than a true termolecular collision.

For elementary processes—and *only* for elementary processes—the rate law directly reflects the molecularity:

| Molecularity | Example | Rate Law |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Unimolecular | $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ | $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]$ |
| Bimolecular | $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ | $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$ |
| Bimolecular | $2\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ | $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^2$ |
| Termolecular | $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} + \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ | $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}][\mathrm{C}]$ |

This direct correspondence between molecularity and reaction order holds because an elementary process represents an actual molecular event. The rate depends on how frequently the required molecular encounters occur. For a unimolecular process, the rate depends only on how many A molecules are present. For a bimolecular process, the rate depends on how often A and B molecules collide—which is proportional to both $[\mathrm{A}]$ and $[\mathrm{B}]$.

## Complex Reactions

Most reactions we encounter are not elementary processes but rather sequences of elementary steps. The H~2~ + Br~2~ reaction, for example, proceeds through a mechanism involving four elementary steps:

1. $\mathrm{Br}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{Br}$ (unimolecular)
2. $\mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{H}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{H} + \mathrm{HBr}$ (bimolecular)
3. $\mathrm{H} + \mathrm{Br}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{HBr}$ (bimolecular)
4. $\mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{Br} \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}_2$ (bimolecular)

Each elementary step follows a simple rate law determined by its molecularity. The *overall* rate law for the complex reaction emerges from how these steps combine—and this is why the overall rate law can be complicated.

For complex reactions, we cannot deduce the rate law from the reaction stoichiometry alone. Rate laws for complex reactions must be determined empirically through analysis of experimental data. However, as we shall see, if we know (or hypothesise) the mechanism, we can predict the rate law—and comparing this prediction with experiment provides evidence for or against the proposed mechanism.

## Units of the Rate Constant

The units of a rate constant depend on the overall order of the reaction. Since both sides of a rate equation must have the same dimensions, we can deduce the units of $k$ from dimensional analysis. For a first-order reaction ($\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]$):

$$\underbrace{\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}\mathrm{\,s}^{-1}}_{\text{rate}} = [k] \times \underbrace{\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}}_{[\mathrm{A}]}$$

so $[k] = \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Repeating this analysis for other orders gives:

| Overall order | Units of $k$ |
|:---:|:---|
| 0 | $\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |
| 1 | $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |
| 2 | $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{dm}^{3}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |
| 3 | $\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\,\mathrm{dm}^{6}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ |

The general pattern for overall order $n$ is:

$$[k] = \mathrm{mol}^{1-n}\,\mathrm{dm}^{3(n-1)}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$

When comparing rate constants, always check that they refer to the same order of reaction—a rate constant of $10^6\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a first-order reaction cannot be directly compared with a rate constant of $10^6\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{dm}^{3}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a second-order reaction.

## Key Concepts

- Thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction *can* occur; kinetics tells us how *fast* it proceeds and by what molecular pathway.
- The reaction rate $\nu$ is defined as the rate of change of concentration, with stoichiometric factors ensuring a single unambiguous value regardless of which species we monitor.
- Mass balance (conservation of mass) provides the physical basis for the stoichiometric factors in rate expressions.
- A rate law describes how the rate depends on concentrations. The reaction orders need not match the stoichiometric coefficients.
- Elementary processes are single molecular events (unimolecular, bimolecular, or termolecular). Only for elementary processes do the orders directly reflect the molecularity.
- Complex reactions consist of sequences of elementary steps. Their rate laws must be determined experimentally.
- The units of a rate constant depend on the overall reaction order: for an $n$th-order reaction, $[k] = \mathrm{mol}^{1-n}\,\mathrm{dm}^{3(n-1)}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

In the next chapter, we will derive *integrated rate laws* that predict how concentrations evolve over time for reactions of different orders, and compare these predictions with experimental data.
