# Integrated Rate Laws

In the previous chapter, we saw that rate laws provide a window into how reactions work at the molecular level. A simple bimolecular reaction such as $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ has the straightforward rate law $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$, but the formation of HBr—despite its simple stoichiometry—follows a complex rate law that reflects a multi-step chain mechanism. Different mechanisms produce different rate laws. To use rate laws as a tool for understanding mechanisms, however, we first need to be able to extract them from experimental data.

The challenge is that our rate laws are written in terms of rates—derivatives such as $\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]/\mathrm{d}t$—whereas what we typically measure in the laboratory is concentration as a function of time. Consider, for example, the thermal decomposition of azomethane (CH~3~N~2~CH~3~), studied at $2.18 \times 10^4\,\mathrm{Pa}$ and $576\,\mathrm{K}$:

| $t$ / min | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $[\text{azomethane}]$ / $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | 8.70 | 6.52 | 4.89 | 3.67 | 2.75 | 2.06 | 1.55 |

What is the rate law for this reaction? What is the rate constant? We cannot answer these questions just by inspecting the raw data—we need a strategy for connecting our differential rate laws to concentration–time measurements.

The approach is straightforward: *propose* a rate law, *integrate* it to predict how $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ should depend on time, and then *compare* that prediction with the experimental data. If the prediction fits, we have our rate law and rate constant; if not, we try a different order. In the sections that follow, we carry out this procedure for zeroth-, first-, and second-order reactions, and then return to the azomethane data to see which model fits.

## From Differential to Integrated Rate Laws

To integrate a differential rate law, we separate variables and integrate both sides between appropriate limits (using the techniques from the [Mathematical Foundations](#mathematical-foundations) chapter). This gives us the **integrated rate law**: an equation that tells us the concentration $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ as a function of time. We then rearrange this into a **linear form**, suitable for graphical analysis, for reasons that will become clear once we have derived the results for several different reaction orders.

## Zeroth-Order Reactions

For a zeroth-order reaction, the rate is constant, independent of the concentration of the reactant:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k$$

Integrating both sides between $t = 0$ (when $[\mathrm{A}] = [\mathrm{A}]_0$) and time $t$ (when $[\mathrm{A}] = [\mathrm{A}]_t$):

$$\int_{[\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\mathrm{A}]_t} \mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}] = \int_0^t -k\,\mathrm{d}t$$

$$[\mathrm{A}]_t - [\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt$$

Rearranging gives the zeroth-order integrated rate law:

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt
(\#eq:zeroth-order-integrated)
\end{equation}

This is already in linear form: a plot of $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ against $t$ gives a straight line with slope $-k$ and intercept $[\mathrm{A}]_0$. Physically, a constant rate means the reaction proceeds at the same speed regardless of how much reactant remains—a situation that can arise, for example, when a reaction is limited by a saturated catalyst surface.

knitr::include_graphics("lecture_2/figures/zeroth_order_linear.png")
```

## First-Order Reactions

For a first-order reaction, the rate is proportional to the concentration of the reactant:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}]$$

We separate variables and integrate:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]} = -k\,\mathrm{d}t$$

$$\int_{[\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\mathrm{A}]_t} \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]} = \int_0^t -k\,\mathrm{d}t$$

$$\ln[\mathrm{A}]_t - \ln[\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt$$

This gives the first-order integrated rate law in linear form:

\begin{equation}
\ln[\mathrm{A}]_t = \ln[\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt
(\#eq:first-order-integrated-linear)
\end{equation}

A plot of $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_t$ against $t$ gives a straight line with slope $-k$ and intercept $\ln[\mathrm{A}]_0$. Taking the exponential of both sides gives the equivalent exponential form:

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}
(\#eq:first-order-integrated-exp)
\end{equation}

This is the exponential decay we derived from general principles in the [Mathematical Foundations](#mathematical-foundations) chapter: whenever a quantity changes at a rate proportional to its current value, the result is an exponential function. First-order kinetics means the concentration decreases by the same *fraction* in each successive time interval.

knitr::include_graphics("lecture_2/figures/first_order_linear.png")
```

## Second-Order Reactions

For a second-order reaction in a single reactant ($2\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \text{products}$):

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}]^2$$

Separating variables and integrating:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]^2} = -k\,\mathrm{d}t$$

$$\int_{[\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\mathrm{A}]_t} \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]^2} = \int_0^t -k\,\mathrm{d}t$$

$$-\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_t} + \frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt$$

Rearranging:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_t} = \frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt
(\#eq:second-order-integrated)
\end{equation}

A plot of $1/[\mathrm{A}]_t$ against $t$ gives a straight line with slope $+k$ and intercept $1/[\mathrm{A}]_0$. Notice that the slope is positive here, unlike the zeroth- and first-order cases where it is negative.

```{r second-order-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Second-order kinetics: plotting $1/[\\mathrm{A}]$ versus $t$ gives a straight line with slope $+k$ and intercept $1/[\\mathrm{A}]_0$.", out.width='45%', fig.align='center'}

```

## Summary and Graphical Analysis

Now that we have worked through each case, the table below collects the key results.

| Order | Integrated form | Linear plot | Slope |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 0 | $[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt$ | $[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 1 | $[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}$ | $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ | $-k$ |
| 2 | $\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_t} = \frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt$ | $\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]}$ vs $t$ | $+k$ |

```{r integrated-rate-laws-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Summary of the integrated rate laws for zeroth-, first-, and second-order reactions. For each reaction order, the differential rate law is integrated to give an expression for $[\\mathrm{A}]_t$, which is then rearranged into a linear form suitable for graphical analysis.", out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_2/figures/integrated_rate_laws_summary.png")
```

Each reaction order predicts a different functional form for concentration as a function of time—a different curve shape. By rearranging each integrated rate law into a linear form, we can distinguish consistent from inconsistent models by simple visual inspection: data that are consistent with a particular rate law will fall on a straight line in the corresponding plot, while data that are inconsistent will show a curve. We can therefore test candidate rate laws by plotting the same dataset in each of the three linear forms and seeing which (if any) gives a straight line. The slope of that line gives the rate constant (Figure \@ref(fig:three-linear-forms)).

```{r three-linear-forms, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The linear form of the integrated rate law for each reaction order. In each case, concentration--time data that obey the corresponding rate law fall on a straight line, with the slope giving the rate constant and the intercept giving the initial concentration.", out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_2/figures/three_linear_forms.png")
```

Although we derived these integrated rate laws for elementary processes, the same graphical tests apply whenever a reaction follows a simple rate law of the form $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^n$—regardless of whether the underlying mechanism involves a single step or multiple steps.

## Worked Example: Decomposition of Azomethane

Let us return to the azomethane data from the start of this chapter and put our new tools to work. Recall the concentration–time data for the thermal decomposition of azomethane at $576\,\mathrm{K}$:

| $t$ / min | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $[\text{azomethane}]$ / $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{mol\,dm}^{-3}$ | 8.70 | 6.52 | 4.89 | 3.67 | 2.75 | 2.06 | 1.55 |

We test each of the three integrated rate laws by plotting the data in the corresponding linear form (as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:three-linear-forms)). Plotting $\ln[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ gives a straight line, consistent with first-order kinetics, with slope $-k = -9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Plotting $[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ or $1/[\text{azomethane}]$ against $t$ gives curves rather than straight lines, ruling out zeroth- and second-order rate laws.

We now have our answer to the question posed at the start of this chapter: the decomposition of azomethane follows first-order kinetics, with a rate constant of $k = 9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.

## Reactions with Two Different Reactants

The integrated rate laws above all involve a single reactant species. For a reaction between two different species, $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \text{products}$, the differential rate law is:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$$

Integration is more complex here because the right-hand side contains two concentrations that both change with time. The problem can be solved analytically using mass balance (from Chapter 1) and partial fractions, giving the full integrated result:

\begin{equation}
kt = \frac{1}{[\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\mathrm{A}]_0} \ln\!\left(\frac{[\mathrm{B}]_t / [\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\mathrm{A}]_t / [\mathrm{A}]_0}\right)
(\#eq:second-order-two-reactants)
\end{equation}

The derivation of this result is given in Appendix \@ref(appendix-two-reactants). You are not expected to reproduce this derivation, but it is worth noting that the result requires $[\mathrm{A}]_0 \neq [\mathrm{B}]_0$ (otherwise the denominator is zero). If the initial concentrations are equal, the problem reduces to the single-reactant second-order case (Eqn. \@ref(eq:second-order-integrated)).

A common and powerful simplification is to use one reactant in large excess. If $[\mathrm{B}]_0 \gg [\mathrm{A}]_0$, then $[\mathrm{B}]$ remains effectively constant throughout the reaction, and the rate law simplifies to:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} \approx -k'[\mathrm{A}] \quad \text{where } k' = k[\mathrm{B}]_0$$

This is called a *pseudo-first-order* rate law: the reaction is second-order overall, but behaves as first-order under these conditions. The problem reduces to the first-order integrated rate law we have already derived—all of the graphical analysis from this chapter applies directly. We will explore the isolation method and pseudo-first-order kinetics fully in the next chapter.

## Key Concepts

- The rate law tells us about the reaction mechanism, so extracting rate laws from experimental data is a central goal of chemical kinetics.
- Integrated rate laws relate concentration to time, connecting differential rate laws to experimentally measurable quantities.
- The strategy is: propose a rate law, integrate to predict $[\mathrm{A}]_t$, and compare with data.
- Each reaction order gives a different integrated rate law with a characteristic linear form.
- Plotting data in the appropriate linear form tests whether a given rate law is consistent with the data. A straight line confirms the proposed order; the slope gives the rate constant.
- For zeroth-order: $[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear (slope $-k$). For first-order: $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear (slope $-k$). For second-order: $1/[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear (slope $+k$).
- First-order kinetics corresponds to exponential decay: $[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\,\mathrm{e}^{-kt}$.
- Reactions between two different species can be simplified to pseudo-first-order kinetics by using one reactant in large excess.
