While thermodynamics tells us about the energetic feasibility and equilibrium state of a reaction, it provides no information about the temporal evolution of the chemical system. Chemical kinetics fills this gap by describing reaction rates and mechanisms. Consider these complementary perspectives: Thermodynamics tells us: Whether a reaction is spontaneous The equilibrium composition Nothing about reaction mechanisms Kinetics reveals: How fast reactions proceed Time required to reach equilibrium Molecular-level reaction pathways 1.2 Concentration Changes in Time Consider a simple reaction where reactant A transforms into product B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] # Figure showing concentration profiles The reaction progress appears as continuous changes in reactant and product concentrations, written as [\\(\\mathrm{A}\\)] and [\\(\\mathrm{B}\\)]. Starting from initial concentrations [\\(\\mathrm{A}\\)]\\(_{t=0}\\) and [\\(\\mathrm{B}\\)]\\(_{t=0}\\), the system evolves toward equilibrium. At any time \\(t\\), the total concentration remains constant: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_{t=0} + [\\mathrm{B}]_{t=0}\\] This conservation reflects the stoichiometric conversion of reactant to product. 1.3 The Reaction Rate The reaction rate quantifies how quickly concentrations change with time. For our A → B reaction, the rate appears as either reactant consumption or product formation: # Figure showing tangent lines These rates are related by: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] The negative sign for \\(d[\\mathrm{A}]/dt\\) ensures a positive rate as reactant is consumed. For reactions with more complex stoichiometry, the rates of different species are proportionally related. For example, in the reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] The rates are related by: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] 1.4 Rate Laws Most reactions follow rate laws that express how reaction speed depends on concentration: # Figure showing molecular collisions A general rate law takes the form: \\[\\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b[\\mathrm{C}]^c\\cdots\\] where: - \\(k\\) is the rate constant - The exponents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are reaction orders - The sum \\((a + b + c + \\cdots)\\) gives the overall order Rate laws emerge from experimental measurement and provide insight into reaction mechanisms. 1.5 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of simple molecular-level steps called elementary processes. The molecularity of an elementary process refers to the number of reactant molecules that must come together for the reaction to occur. Understanding molecularity helps us classify elementary processes into three types: # Figure showing elementary steps Unimolecular processes involve a single reactant molecule transforming into products: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Examples include isomerization or decomposition reactions. Bimolecular processes require collision between two reactant molecules: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Most elementary reactions are bimolecular. Termolecular processes involve simultaneous collision of three molecules: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\] These are rare because simultaneous three-body collisions are statistically unlikely. For elementary processes, the reaction order always equals the molecularity - a direct reflection of the number of molecules that must collide for reaction to occur. 1.6 The Mathematics of Kinetics Concentration profiles and reaction rates connect through calculus: # Figure showing calculus relationship The fundamental relationship is: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - \\int_0^t \\nu\\,dt\\] where \\(\\nu\\) represents the reaction rate. This relationship allows us to predict concentration changes from known rate laws or determine rate laws from experimental concentration data. 1.7 Units of Rate Constants Rate constant units maintain dimensional consistency in rate laws: For first-order reactions (rate = \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)): \\[\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\text{s}^{-1} = k \\times \\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\] \\[k \\text{ has units } \\text{s}^{-1}\\] For second-order reactions (rate = \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)): \\[\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\text{s}^{-1} = k \\times (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3})^2\\] \\[k \\text{ has units } \\text{mol}^{-1}\\text{dm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}\\] "],["chemical-kinetics-and-reaction-mechanisms.html", "Lecture 2 Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms 2.1 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms 2.2 Elementary Processes and Rate Laws 2.3 Building and Testing Kinetic Models 2.4 Connecting Mechanisms to Observable Kinetics 2.5 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms 2.6 Principles of Rate Law Analysis 2.7 Building a Kinetic Model 2.8 From Model to Mechanism 2.9 The Role of Integrated Rate Laws 2.10 Beyond First-Order Kinetics", " Lecture 2 Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms 2.1 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms Understanding how chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level presents a fundamental challenge in physical chemistry. While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes.

When we measure reactant and product concentrations over time, we observe characteristic concentration profiles like those shown in Figure 1. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, the reactant concentration decreases exponentially while the product concentration rises in a complementary fashion. The instantaneous reaction rate at any point equals the gradient of the tangent to these concentration curves, providing our best linear estimate of the rate at that specific moment: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\text{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] 2.2 Elementary Processes and Rate Laws For elementary processes (single-step reactions), rate laws directly reflect reaction molecularity. Consider these common examples: Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]\\] Bimolecular reaction: \\[\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}][\\text{B}]\\] Bimolecular reaction (identical reactants): \\[2\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]^2\\] Figure 2: Schematic diagrams showing elementary reaction steps - Panel A: Unimolecular decomposition (single molecule breaking apart) - Panel B: Bimolecular reaction (two different molecules colliding) - Panel C: Bimolecular reaction with identical reactants - Caption: Molecular-level representations of elementary reaction steps and their corresponding rate laws. 2.3 Building and Testing Kinetic Models Consider a unimolecular decomposition reaction where each molecule has a constant probability of reaction per unit time: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c\\] Figure 3: Time-series visualization of simulated molecular conversion - Grid of circles showing molecule states at different time points - Yellow circles: reactant A molecules - Blue circles: product B molecules - Time progression from left to right - Caption: Simulation snapshots showing the probabilistic conversion of reactant molecules (yellow) to products (blue) over time. This molecular picture suggests an exponential decay model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] Taking the natural logarithm transforms this into a linear relationship: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] Figure 4: Plot of linearized kinetic data - x-axis: time - y-axis: ln[A] - Data points showing linear trend - Fitted line with slope -k - Caption: Linearized plot of concentration data confirming first-order kinetics. The negative slope equals the rate constant k. The linear fit in Figure 4 confirms our first-order kinetic model. Differentiating our concentration expression reveals the underlying rate law: \\[\\begin{align*} \\nu &amp;= -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}] \\end{align*}\\] This analysis demonstrates that: 1.

Different mechanisms predict distinct concentration profiles and rate laws. By carefully analyzing kinetic data, we can: 1. Validate proposed mechanisms 2. Determine reaction orders 3. Extract rate constants 4. Predict reaction progress In the next lecture, we’ll explore systematic methods for: - Deriving integrated rate laws from proposed mechanisms - Testing kinetic models against experimental data - Building evidence for reaction mechanisms through kinetic analysis 2.5 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms Understanding how chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level presents a fundamental challenge in physical chemistry. While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes. By measuring how reactant and product concentrations change over time, we can test hypothetical reaction mechanisms and build deeper understanding of chemical reactivity. 2.6 Principles of Rate Law Analysis When analyzing reaction kinetics, we typically begin with time-resolved measurements of reactant and product concentrations. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, these data reveal characteristic concentration profiles: an exponential decay of reactant A matched by a complementary rise in product B. The mathematical relationship between these profiles and the underlying molecular processes forms the foundation of chemical kinetics. Consider a hypothetical unimolecular decomposition reaction. At the molecular level, each molecule of A has some probability of converting to B in any given time interval. This microscopic behavior manifests in measurable changes in bulk concentration. The connection between these molecular events and macroscopic observations lies at the heart of kinetic analysis. 2.7 Building a Kinetic Model To understand this connection quantitatively, we can construct a molecular simulation that captures the essential physics of unimolecular decomposition: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c \\quad \\text{per molecule per unit time}\\] This simple probability rule generates concentration profiles that closely match experimental observations. From these profiles, we can extract key kinetic parameters that characterize the reaction. The mathematical framework for analyzing these data begins with a proposed kinetic model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] where λ represents a decay constant characteristic of the reaction. Taking the natural logarithm transforms this exponential relationship into a linear form: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] This transformation provides a straightforward method for testing the model against experimental data - a linear relationship between ln[A] and t supports first-order kinetics. 2.8 From Model to Mechanism The proposed kinetic model implies a specific rate law, which we can derive through differentiation: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]\\] This result reveals three important insights: 1. The reaction rate depends linearly on reactant concentration 2. The decay constant λ corresponds to the rate constant k 3. The reaction follows first-order kinetics These findings align perfectly with our molecular picture of unimolecular decomposition, where each molecule reacts independently with constant probability. The rate constant k, typically measured in s-1, quantifies this probability. 2.9 The Role of Integrated Rate Laws The expression we derived for A represents an integrated rate law - the mathematical solution to our differential rate equation. This relationship between concentration and time provides a crucial bridge between experimental measurements and molecular mechanisms. Through careful analysis of kinetic data, we can: Validate proposed reaction mechanisms Determine reaction orders Extract rate constants Predict reaction progress 2.10 Beyond First-Order Kinetics While unimolecular decomposition provides a straightforward example of kinetic analysis, many reactions follow more complex rate laws. In the next chapter, we’ll explore systematic methods for: Deriving integrated rate laws from proposed mechanisms Testing kinetic models against experimental data Building evidence for reaction mechanisms These tools form an essential framework for understanding chemical reactivity across a broad range of systems.

In our previous lecture, we examined unimolecular decomposition reactions, starting with experimental data that showed exponential decay in concentration. By proposing an exponential model and differentiating, we demonstrated consistency with first-order kinetics—a mathematical signature of unimolecular mechanisms. While illuminating, this approach relied heavily on choosing the correct model function. Different functions with similar shapes would have yielded different rate laws upon differentiation, potentially inconsistent with the known unimolecular mechanism. This highlights a key limitation of working from data to mechanism. # Insert comparison diagram from slides 3.2 Systematic Kinetic Analysis In practice, kinetic analysis typically proceeds in the opposite direction: Propose a plausible reaction mechanism Write down the corresponding differential rate law Integrate this rate law to obtain an integrated rate law Compare this integrated rate law with experimental data This systematic approach provides a rigorous test of mechanistic hypotheses. When experimental data match our derived integrated rate law, we have evidence supporting our proposed mechanism. Equally importantly, when they don’t match, we can conclusively reject that mechanism and must consider alternatives. 3.3 Simple Integrated Rate Laws We focus here on simple integrated rate laws—those corresponding to single-step reaction mechanisms. For any such mechanism, our analysis follows these steps: Propose a single-step mechanism Write the differential rate law Integrate to obtain the integrated rate law Rearrange into linear form Compare with experimental data # Insert flowchart from slides The linear form proves particularly useful because it allows straightforward graphical analysis: if experimental data plotted in this form give a straight line, the data are consistent with our proposed mechanism. 3.4 Zeroth-Order Kinetics For a zeroth-order mechanism, where rate is independent of concentration: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\] To obtain the integrated rate law: Rearrange into integral form: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Rearrange to obtain the integrated rate law: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This is already in linear form. This equation tells us that if our reaction follows zeroth-order kinetics, then a plot \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) should give a straight line with slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plot from slides 3.5 First-Order Kinetics For a unimolecular mechanism: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Express as the integrated rate law: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.6 Second-Order Kinetics For a bimolecular mechanism with identical molecules: \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]}]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt\\] Rearrange to give integrated rate law: \\[\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(k\\) and intercept = \\(1/[A]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.7 More Complex Second-Order Processes For reactions between different species (A + B → P): \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Integration is more complex due to the two-variable dependence: Use stoichiometric relationships: If \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\neq [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\), then \\([\\mathrm{B}] - [\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) = constant Let \\([\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - ([\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}])\\) Substitute and integrate to obtain: \\[kt = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]/[\\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\\mathrm{A}]/[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\right)\\] # Insert diagram from slides 3.7.1 Pseudo-First-Order Conditions When one reactant is in large excess (e.g., \\([\\mathrm{A}] \\gg [\\mathrm{B}]\\)): \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) remains effectively constant 2 .

While theoretical understanding of reaction mechanisms can suggest potential rate laws, ultimately we must determine these laws empirically through careful analysis of kinetic data. In this chapter, we explore four complementary methods for extracting rate law information from concentration-time measurements. 4.2 The Integral Method 4.2.1 Theoretical Background As we saw in Lecture 3, different rate laws lead to different integrated rate laws, each predicting distinct functional forms for the time evolution of reactant concentrations. This provides a powerful method for determining rate laws: we can compare experimental concentration-time data against these predicted functional forms. The standard method involves transforming the integrated rate laws into linear form. The key relationships are summarised below: Order Rate Law Integrated Rate Law Linear Form 0 \\(\\nu = \\color{660099}{k}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 1 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-kt}\\) \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 2 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\) By plotting experimental data in these linear forms, we can readily identify which rate law best describes our reaction. 4.2.2 Example: Testing for Second-Order Kinetics Consider experimental data showing the decay of reactant A. To test whether these data are consistent with second-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t}\\) versus \\(t\\). A straight line would indicate consistency with second-order kinetics, with slope \\(k\\) and intercept \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\). 4.2.3 Example: Decomposition of Azomethane The decomposition of azomethane was studied at a pressure of \\(2.18 \\times 10^4\\) Pa and temperature of 576 K, yielding the following concentration-time data: \\(t\\) / minutes 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) / \\(10^{-3}\\) mol dm\\(^{-3}\\) 8.70 6.52 4.89 3.67 2.75 2.06 1.55 To test for first-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\ln[\\text{azomethane}]\\) versus \\(t\\). The resulting linear plot (with slope \\(-k = -9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\) min\\(^{-1}\\)) confirms first-order behaviour. 4.2.4 A Note on Modern Analysis Methods While we have focused on analysing concentration-time data using linear transformations, this is not the only approach. Modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original form. However, the linear analysis method presented here remains valuable both for understanding the mathematical relationships involved and for providing a straightforward way to identify compatible rate laws from experimental data. 4.3 The Half-Life Method 4.3.1 Characteristic Exponential Decay First-order kinetics corresponds to characteristic exponential decay, where the concentration decreases by the same proportion in any fixed time interval. This leads to a key diagnostic: if we examine the time taken for the concentration to fall to \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of its initial value (where \\(n\\) is any number), this time interval remains constant throughout the reaction. The “half-life” (\\(t_{1/2}\\)) represents the special case where \\(n = 2\\), but there is nothing unique about this choice. For a first-order reaction: \\[t_{1/n} = \\frac{\\ln(n)}{k}\\] 4.3.2 Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited Returning to our azomethane data, we can verify first-order kinetics by showing that successive time intervals required for the concentration to halve remain constant. From the data: Time interval Initial [A] Final [A] Δt First half-life 8.70 4.35 72.3 Second half-life 4.35 2.18 72.3 The constant half-life provides independent confirmation of first-order kinetics. 4.4 The Isolation Method For reactions involving multiple reactants, the isolation method allows us to determine partial reaction orders by artificially simplifying the kinetics. By using a large excess of all but one reactant, their concentrations remain effectively constant throughout the reaction. Consider our bimolecular reaction: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta\\] If \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) then \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) and: \\[\\nu = k^\\prime[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha\\] where \\(k^\\prime = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0^\\beta\\) is a pseudo-rate constant. To determine \\(\\beta\\), we can repeat the experiment with different initial concentrations of B: \\[\\ln k^\\prime = \\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln k^\\prime\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\beta\\). 4.5 The Differential Method The differential method works directly with reaction rates rather than integrated concentration profiles. Taking logarithms of the rate law: \\[\\ln\\nu = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}] + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]\\] Using initial rates with varying starting concentrations: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] When \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) is held constant: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = (\\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0) + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln\\nu_0\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\alpha\\). 4.6 Summary These four methods provide complementary approaches to rate law determination: The integral method compares experimental data against predicted concentration-time profiles The half-life method identifies first-order behaviour through time interval analysis The isolation method simplifies complex kinetics to determine partial orders The differential method uses initial rates to directly determine reaction orders Each method has particular strengths and limitations. The choice of method often depends on the specific reaction system and available experimental data.

Understanding how these complex reaction mechanisms give rise to experimentally observed kinetic behavior requires careful analysis of each step and consideration of how these steps work together to control the overall reaction rate. 5.2 Consecutive Reactions Consider the following reaction mechanism that consists of two elementary steps and proceeds through a single intermediate B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] This type of reaction sequence, where one product becomes the reactant for a subsequent step, is called a consecutive reaction. To analyze the kinetics, we need to write differential rate equations for each species: For reactant A: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] For intermediate B: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] For product C: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] # Plot showing [A], [B], and [C] versus time 5.2.1 Solving the Rate Equations Starting with the initial conditions at \\(t = 0\\): - \\([\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) - \\([\\mathrm{B}] = 0\\) - \\([\\mathrm{C}] = 0\\) We can solve these equations step by step: First, the equation for A is a simple first-order decay: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Which integrates to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-k_1t}\\] For B, we substitute this result: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + k_2[\\mathrm{B}] = k_1[\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-k_1t}\\] This is a linear first-order differential equation. Its solution is: \\[[\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{k_1}{k_2-k_1}[\\mathrm{A}]_0(e^{-k_1t} - e^{-k_2t})\\] For C, we can use conservation of mass: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\] Substituting gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1 + \\frac{k_1e^{-k_2t} - k_2e^{-k_1t}}{k_2-k_1}\\right)\\] 5.2.2 Rate-Determining Step In consecutive reactions, one step often proceeds much more slowly than the others, effectively controlling the overall reaction rate. This rate-determining step emerges naturally from the mathematical analysis of the reaction kinetics. When analyzing concentration profiles for consecutive reactions, two limiting cases arise depending on the relative magnitudes of \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\): When \\(k_1 \\gg k_2\\): # Plot showing case where k1 &gt;&gt; k2 B builds up quickly then decays slowly The slow second step is rate-determining \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-e^{-k_2t})\\) When \\(k_1 \\ll k_2\\): # Plot showing case where k1 &lt;&lt; k2 B remains at low concentration The slow first step is rate-determining \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-e^{-k_1t})\\) 5.3 Equilibrium Reactions Many reactions reach a dynamic equilibrium rather than proceeding to completion: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B}\\] The rate equations are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] At equilibrium, concentrations no longer change, so the net rates become zero: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] This condition gives: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}] = k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = K_\\mathrm{eq}\\] This important result connects kinetics (rate constants) with thermodynamics (equilibrium constant). 5.4 Pre-equilibrium Mechanisms Some reactions establish a rapid equilibrium between reactants and an intermediate before slowly converting to products. A common example is acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis: \\(\\ce{CH3COOCH3 + H3O+ &lt;=&gt; CH3COOCH4+ + H2O}\\) (fast equilibrium) \\(\\ce{CH3COOCH4+ + H2O -&gt; CH3COOH + CH3OH + H3O+}\\) (slow) This behavior, called a pre-equilibrium mechanism, occurs when: - The forward and reverse rates of the first step are much faster than the second step - The first step reaches equilibrium before significant product formation - The overall rate depends on both the equilibrium constant and the rate of the second step In general terms, a pre-equilibrium mechanism has the form: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] The rate equations are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] When \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\), the first step rapidly reaches equilibrium: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{C}]}{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = K\\] This gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] The overall rate becomes: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}] = k_2K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{k_2k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] # Plot showing pre-equilibrium kinetics This second-order rate law emerges from a more complex mechanism through the pre-equilibrium approximation. The overall rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_2k_1/k_{-1}\\) combines the individual rate constants from each step in the mechanism.

However, for many reactions, the complete kinetic analysis becomes mathematically intractable. In cases where the reaction intermediates are highly reactive and are quickly converted into products, we can apply a simplifying approximation called the Steady State Approximation, which often allows us to simplify the differential rate equations to derive an approximate mathematical description of the overall reaction rate. Consider a reaction pathway involving a reactive intermediate B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] The concentration of intermediate B changes through three competing processes: - Formation from reactant A (rate \\(k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\)) - Back-reaction to A (rate \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\)) - Forward reaction to product C (rate \\(k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\)) # Figure showing competing processes affecting [B] # - Blue arrow showing formation from A # - Red arrow showing back-reaction to A # - Green arrow showing conversion to C Under steady state conditions, the intermediate’s concentration remains approximately constant because its rate of formation equals its rate of consumption. Mathematically, this means: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0\\] This approximation doesn’t imply that [B] = 0, but rather that [B] rapidly reaches and maintains a nearly constant value throughout most of the reaction. 6.2 Analysis of Pre-equilibrium Systems Let’s examine a mechanism involving both equilibrium and steady state behavior: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] The complete set of rate equations for this system is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\end{align*}\\] # Plot showing concentration profiles over time # - [A] and [B] decreasing # - [C] reaching steady state rapidly # - [D] increasing as product forms 6.2.1 Application of the Steady State Approximation We apply the steady state approximation to intermediate C: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\approx 0\\] This equation can be rearranged: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[\\mathrm{C}]\\] Solving for [C]: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\] The overall reaction rate becomes: \\[\\begin{align*} \\nu &amp;= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ &amp;= k_2\\left(\\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k_2k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\end{align*}\\] 6.2.2 Analysis of Limiting Cases Two important limiting behaviors emerge from this rate law: Pre-equilibrium Limit (\\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\)): \\[\\nu = \\frac{k_2k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] The reaction exhibits second-order kinetics with an effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{eff} = k_2k_1/k_{-1}\\). Rate-determining Step Limit (\\(k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\gg k_{-1}\\)): \\[\\nu = k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] The reaction shows first-order kinetics with rate constant \\(k_1\\). # Side-by-side plots comparing concentration profiles # Left: Pre-equilibrium case # Right: Rate-determining step case 6.3 Mathematical Foundation of Steady State Behavior Consider a general reaction system where an intermediate species I is: - Produced with rate \\(\\nu_f\\) - Consumed with rate proportional to [I] The rate equation is: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\nu_f - k[\\mathrm{I}]\\] This linear first-order differential equation has the solution: \\[[\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{k}(1 - e^{-kt})\\] This solution shows that: 1. [I] approaches steady state value \\(\\nu_f/k\\) exponentially 2. Characteristic time to reach steady state is \\(1/k\\) 3. Steady state approximation is valid when \\(t \\gg 1/k\\) # Plot showing: # - Exponential approach to steady state # - Characteristic time marked # - Steady state value indicated 6.4 Validation Criteria for Steady State The steady state approximation is valid when: 1. The intermediate concentration remains small throughout the reaction 2. The intermediate reaches steady state rapidly compared to overall reaction time 3. The steady state persists for most of the reaction duration # Side-by-side plots: # Left: Valid steady state case # Right: Invalid case where approximation fails These criteria can be assessed by comparing characteristic timescales: - \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{SS} = 1/k\\) for reaching steady state - \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{rxn}\\) for overall reaction progress The approximation is valid when \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{SS} \\ll \\tau_\\mathrm{rxn}\\).

A classic example is the thermal decomposition of azomethane: \\[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_6} + \\mathrm{N_2}\\] At high pressures, this reaction exhibits first-order kinetics: \\[-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]\\] This simple rate law presents us with a fundamental mechanistic puzzle when we examine the molecular-level implications. We observe two seemingly contradictory behaviors: The reaction shows first-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)), suggesting each molecule reacts independently. The rate increases with temperature, indicating that energy is required to overcome an activation barrier. But how does each molecule acquire this activation energy? If the activation energy came from molecular collisions (the usual mechanism for thermal activation), we would expect the rate to depend on the frequency of these collisions. Since collision frequency is proportional to the concentration of both colliding species, this would lead to second-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)). Yet we observe first-order behavior. # Insert diagram comparing collision-based activation (suggesting second-order) with observed first-order behavior This puzzle suggests that a more complex mechanism must be at work - one that can explain both the thermal activation and the first-order kinetics. 7.1.1 The Lindemann Mechanism In 1921, Frederick Lindemann proposed a three-step mechanism to explain this behavior: Excitation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Deactivation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{P}\\] Here, M represents any collision partner (often the reactant molecule itself), and A* represents an energetically excited molecule. # Insert diagram from slides showing the three steps 7.1.2 Mathematical Analysis We can apply the steady-state approximation to the excited intermediate A*: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A^*}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A^*}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}] = 0\\] Solving for [A*]: \\[[\\mathrm{A^*}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2}\\] The overall reaction rate is determined by the decomposition of A*: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}] = \\frac{k_1k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2}\\] For the specific case of azomethane decomposition, where M = CH3N2CH3: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_1k_2[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]^2}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] + k_2}\\] 7.1.3 High-Pressure Limit At high pressures, collisional deactivation is much faster than unimolecular decomposition (\\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] \\gg k_2\\)). Under these conditions: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]\\] This simplifies to first-order kinetics with an effective rate constant \\(k = \\frac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\\), explaining the observed behavior. 7.1.4 Low-Pressure Limit Conversely, at low pressures where \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] \\ll k_2\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]^2\\] The reaction shows second-order kinetics with \\(k = k_1\\). This prediction was experimentally verified in 1927, providing strong support for the Lindemann mechanism. 7.2 Third-Order Reactions Some reactions exhibit third-order kinetics, such as the oxidation of nitric oxide: \\[2\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] with rate law: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{NO_2}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}]\\] 7.2.1 Mechanistic Implications A simple termolecular collision mechanism seems implausible - simultaneous three-body collisions are extremely rare. Moreover, the reaction rate decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting a more complex mechanism. # Insert diagram from slides showing conservation of momentum and energy An alternative mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium better explains these observations: \\[\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{NO} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} (\\mathrm{NO})_2\\] \\[(\\mathrm{NO})_2 + \\mathrm{O_2} \\xrightarrow{k_2} 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] At equilibrium: \\[K = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{[(\\mathrm{NO})_2]}{[\\mathrm{NO}]^2}\\] The overall rate: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{NO_2}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2k_2[(\\mathrm{NO})_2][\\mathrm{O_2}] = 2k_2K[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}]\\] This mechanism explains both the observed third-order kinetics and the negative temperature dependence (as the pre-equilibrium favors dissociation at higher temperatures). 7.2.2 Formation of Ozone TODO: write this entire section Similar principles apply to ozone formation: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3}\\] To understand why ozone formation requires a third body, let’s examine what happens in a simple bimolecular collision between O and O2. Consider the conservation laws that must be satisfied: Conservation of Momentum: For a head-on collision between O and O2: \\(m_\\mathrm{O}v_\\mathrm{O} + m_\\mathrm{O_2}v_\\mathrm{O_2} = m_\\mathrm{O_3}v_\\mathrm{O_3}\\) Conservation of Energy: The total energy (kinetic + internal) must be conserved. When O and O2 collide, their relative kinetic energy must be converted into: Kinetic energy of O3 Internal energy (vibrational and rotational) of O3 # Insert diagram from slides showing bimolecular collision process When O and O2 collide, energy conservation gives us crucial insights into the reaction energetics. Consider a head-on collision: Initially, we have: Kinetic energy of the colliding molecules Electronic and vibrational energy of O2 Potential energy stored in the reactants During bond formation: New O-O bonds form in O3 This lowers the system’s potential energy By conservation of energy, this energy must appear elsewhere in the system The energy released by bond formation must be distributed into: Translational kinetic energy of the O3 molecule Internal (vibrational and rotational) energy of O3 # Insert diagram showing energy conversion during collision The fundamental problem is that in a two-body collision, conservation of momentum severely constrains how this released energy can be distributed. Most of it ends up as vibrational energy of the O3 molecule, creating a highly excited O3* that rapidly dissociates back to O + O2. This explains why a third body M is essential - it provides additional degrees of freedom for redistributing the energy released during bond formation. To form stable O3, this excess vibrational energy must be removed. This is where a third body M (typically O or O2) becomes essential. The reaction proceeds through two steps: Formation of excited ozone: \\(\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{O_3^*}\\) Collisional deactivation: \\(\\mathrm{O_3^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3} + \\mathrm{M}\\) # Insert diagram showing energy transfer to third body In this mechanism, M carries away the excess energy as translational or internal energy, allowing the O3 molecule to stabilize. This necessity for a third body leads to the observed third-order kinetics: \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{O_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2K[\\mathrm{O}][\\mathrm{O_2}][\\mathrm{M}]\\) This analysis mirrors our earlier discussion of NO2 formation, where a similar pre-equilibrium mechanism explains the observed third-order rate law. # Insert diagram from slides showing energy transfer to third body "],["mass-balance-in-chemical-kinetics.html", "A Mass Balance in Chemical Kinetics A.1 The Origins of Mass Balance A.2 From Mass Balance to Rate Relationships A.3 Mass Balance with Stoichiometry A.4 Generalizing to Complex Reactions A.5 Equilibrium Reactions and Mass Balance A.6 Key Principles", " A Mass Balance in Chemical Kinetics In Lecture 1, we encountered a fundamental relationship between reaction rates and concentration changes. For any species X involved in a reaction, its rate of concentration change is related to the overall reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) by: \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of X (positive for products, negative for reactants). This elegant relationship unifies the rates of change of all species in a reaction—but where does it come from? The answer lies in a fundamental principle of chemistry: the conservation of mass. When we examine how reaction concentrations evolve over time, mass balance relationships provide the key to understanding how different species’ rates of change are connected. This appendix explores how mass conservation leads naturally to these rate relationships. A.1 The Origins of Mass Balance Consider a simple reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] While concentrations of A and B change over time, the total mass of the system remains constant - this is the principle of conservation of mass. For this simple reaction, at any time \\(t\\): \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] where \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) are the initial concentrations at \\(t=0\\). # Plot showing [A] and [B] vs time with horizontal line showing constant total In cases where \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\) (starting with pure reactant), this simplifies to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A.2 From Mass Balance to Rate Relationships The mass balance equation provides a constraint that links the rates of change of A and B. Taking the derivative with respect to time: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}([\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Since \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) is constant, its derivative is zero: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This tells us that for this simple reaction, the rate of formation of B equals the rate of consumption of A. A.3 Mass Balance with Stoichiometry Now consider a reaction where one molecule of A produces two molecules of B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{B}\\] # Diagram showing A → 2B transformation The mass balance equation becomes: \\[2[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = 2[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] The factor of 2 for [A] accounts for the fact that each A molecule contains the mass equivalent of two B molecules. Taking the derivative: \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This shows that B is produced twice as fast as A is consumed, consistent with the stoichiometry. A.4 Generalizing to Complex Reactions For a general reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C} + 3\\mathrm{D}\\] The reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) can be expressed in terms of any species’ concentration change: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This leads to the general form: \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species X (negative for reactants, positive for products). A.5 Equilibrium Reactions and Mass Balance For an equilibrium reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} 2\\mathrm{B}\\] # Diagram showing equilibrium with labeled rate constants The rate of change of [A] has contributions from both forward and reverse reactions: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]^2\\] The first term represents unimolecular decomposition of A, while the second term represents the bimolecular recombination of B. Similarly for B: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +2k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - 2k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]^2\\] These equations satisfy mass balance: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] A.6 Key Principles Total mass is conserved in chemical reactions Mass balance provides constraints on concentration changes Stoichiometric coefficients determine the relative rates of concentration changes Mass balance applies to both irreversible and equilibrium reactions # Diagram illustrating key concepts "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
