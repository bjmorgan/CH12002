While thermodynamics tells us about the energetic feasibility and equilibrium state of a reaction, it provides no information about the temporal evolution of the chemical system. Chemical kinetics fills this gap by describing reaction rates and mechanisms. Consider these complementary perspectives: Thermodynamics tells us: Whether a reaction is spontaneous The equilibrium composition Nothing about reaction mechanisms Kinetics reveals: How fast reactions proceed Time required to reach equilibrium Molecular-level reaction pathways 1.2 Concentration Changes in Time Consider a simple reaction where reactant A transforms into product B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] # Figure showing concentration profiles The reaction progress appears as continuous changes in reactant and product concentrations, written as [\\(\\mathrm{A}\\)] and [\\(\\mathrm{B}\\)]. Starting from initial concentrations [\\(\\mathrm{A}\\)]\\(_{t=0}\\) and [\\(\\mathrm{B}\\)]\\(_{t=0}\\), the system evolves toward equilibrium. At any time \\(t\\), the total concentration remains constant: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_{t=0} + [\\mathrm{B}]_{t=0}\\] This conservation reflects the stoichiometric conversion of reactant to product. 1.3 The Reaction Rate The reaction rate quantifies how quickly concentrations change with time. For our A → B reaction, the rate appears as either reactant consumption or product formation: # Figure showing tangent lines These rates are related by: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] The negative sign for \\(d[\\mathrm{A}]/dt\\) ensures a positive rate as reactant is consumed. For reactions with more complex stoichiometry, the rates of different species are proportionally related. For example, in the reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] The rates are related by: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] 1.4 Rate Laws Most reactions follow rate laws that express how reaction speed depends on concentration: # Figure showing molecular collisions A general rate law takes the form: \\[\\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b[\\mathrm{C}]^c\\cdots\\] where: - \\(k\\) is the rate constant - The exponents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are reaction orders - The sum \\((a + b + c + \\cdots)\\) gives the overall order Rate laws emerge from experimental measurement and provide insight into reaction mechanisms. 1.5 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of simple molecular-level steps called elementary processes. The molecularity of an elementary process refers to the number of reactant molecules that must come together for the reaction to occur. Understanding molecularity helps us classify elementary processes into three types: # Figure showing elementary steps Unimolecular processes involve a single reactant molecule transforming into products: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Examples include isomerization or decomposition reactions. Bimolecular processes require collision between two reactant molecules: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Most elementary reactions are bimolecular. Termolecular processes involve simultaneous collision of three molecules: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\text{products} \\qquad \\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\] These are rare because simultaneous three-body collisions are statistically unlikely. For elementary processes, the reaction order always equals the molecularity - a direct reflection of the number of molecules that must collide for reaction to occur. 1.6 The Mathematics of Kinetics Concentration profiles and reaction rates connect through calculus: # Figure showing calculus relationship The fundamental relationship is: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - \\int_0^t \\nu\\,dt\\] where \\(\\nu\\) represents the reaction rate. This relationship allows us to predict concentration changes from known rate laws or determine rate laws from experimental concentration data. 1.7 Units of Rate Constants Rate constant units maintain dimensional consistency in rate laws: For first-order reactions (rate = \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)): \\[\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\text{s}^{-1} = k \\times \\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\] \\[k \\text{ has units } \\text{s}^{-1}\\] For second-order reactions (rate = \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)): \\[\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3}\\text{s}^{-1} = k \\times (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{dm}^{-3})^2\\] \\[k \\text{ has units } \\text{mol}^{-1}\\text{dm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}\\] "],["chemical-kinetics-and-reaction-mechanisms.html", "Lecture 2 Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms 2.1 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms 2.2 Elementary Processes and Rate Laws 2.3 Building and Testing Kinetic Models 2.4 Connecting Mechanisms to Observable Kinetics 2.5 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms 2.6 Principles of Rate Law Analysis 2.7 Building a Kinetic Model 2.8 From Model to Mechanism 2.9 The Role of Integrated Rate Laws 2.10 Beyond First-Order Kinetics", " Lecture 2 Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms 2.1 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms Understanding how chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level presents a fundamental challenge in physical chemistry. While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes.

When we measure reactant and product concentrations over time, we observe characteristic concentration profiles like those shown in Figure 1. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, the reactant concentration decreases exponentially while the product concentration rises in a complementary fashion. The instantaneous reaction rate at any point equals the gradient of the tangent to these concentration curves, providing our best linear estimate of the rate at that specific moment: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt}\\] 2.2 Elementary Processes and Rate Laws For elementary processes (single-step reactions), rate laws directly reflect reaction molecularity. Consider these common examples: Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]\\] Bimolecular reaction: \\[\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}][\\text{B}]\\] Bimolecular reaction (identical reactants): \\[2\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]^2\\] Figure 2: Schematic diagrams showing elementary reaction steps - Panel A: Unimolecular decomposition (single molecule breaking apart) - Panel B: Bimolecular reaction (two different molecules colliding) - Panel C: Bimolecular reaction with identical reactants - Caption: Molecular-level representations of elementary reaction steps and their corresponding rate laws. 2.3 Building and Testing Kinetic Models Consider a unimolecular decomposition reaction where each molecule has a constant probability of reaction per unit time: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c\\] Figure 3: Time-series visualization of simulated molecular conversion - Grid of circles showing molecule states at different time points - Yellow circles: reactant A molecules - Blue circles: product B molecules - Time progression from left to right - Caption: Simulation snapshots showing the probabilistic conversion of reactant molecules (yellow) to products (blue) over time. This molecular picture suggests an exponential decay model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] Taking the natural logarithm transforms this into a linear relationship: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] Figure 4: Plot of linearized kinetic data - x-axis: time - y-axis: ln[A] - Data points showing linear trend - Fitted line with slope -k - Caption: Linearized plot of concentration data confirming first-order kinetics. The negative slope equals the rate constant k. The linear fit in Figure 4 confirms our first-order kinetic model. Differentiating our concentration expression reveals the underlying rate law: \\[\\begin{align*} \\nu &amp;= -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}] \\end{align*}\\] This analysis demonstrates that: 1.

Different mechanisms predict distinct concentration profiles and rate laws. By carefully analyzing kinetic data, we can: 1. Validate proposed mechanisms 2. Determine reaction orders 3. Extract rate constants 4. Predict reaction progress In the next lecture, we’ll explore systematic methods for: - Deriving integrated rate laws from proposed mechanisms - Testing kinetic models against experimental data - Building evidence for reaction mechanisms through kinetic analysis 2.5 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms Understanding how chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level presents a fundamental challenge in physical chemistry. While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes. By measuring how reactant and product concentrations change over time, we can test hypothetical reaction mechanisms and build deeper understanding of chemical reactivity. 2.6 Principles of Rate Law Analysis When analyzing reaction kinetics, we typically begin with time-resolved measurements of reactant and product concentrations. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, these data reveal characteristic concentration profiles: an exponential decay of reactant A matched by a complementary rise in product B. The mathematical relationship between these profiles and the underlying molecular processes forms the foundation of chemical kinetics. Consider a hypothetical unimolecular decomposition reaction. At the molecular level, each molecule of A has some probability of converting to B in any given time interval. This microscopic behavior manifests in measurable changes in bulk concentration. The connection between these molecular events and macroscopic observations lies at the heart of kinetic analysis. 2.7 Building a Kinetic Model To understand this connection quantitatively, we can construct a molecular simulation that captures the essential physics of unimolecular decomposition: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c \\quad \\text{per molecule per unit time}\\] This simple probability rule generates concentration profiles that closely match experimental observations. From these profiles, we can extract key kinetic parameters that characterize the reaction. The mathematical framework for analyzing these data begins with a proposed kinetic model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] where λ represents a decay constant characteristic of the reaction. Taking the natural logarithm transforms this exponential relationship into a linear form: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] This transformation provides a straightforward method for testing the model against experimental data - a linear relationship between ln[A] and t supports first-order kinetics. 2.8 From Model to Mechanism The proposed kinetic model implies a specific rate law, which we can derive through differentiation: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]\\] This result reveals three important insights: 1. The reaction rate depends linearly on reactant concentration 2. The decay constant λ corresponds to the rate constant k 3. The reaction follows first-order kinetics These findings align perfectly with our molecular picture of unimolecular decomposition, where each molecule reacts independently with constant probability. The rate constant k, typically measured in s-1, quantifies this probability. 2.9 The Role of Integrated Rate Laws The expression we derived for A represents an integrated rate law - the mathematical solution to our differential rate equation. This relationship between concentration and time provides a crucial bridge between experimental measurements and molecular mechanisms. Through careful analysis of kinetic data, we can: Validate proposed reaction mechanisms Determine reaction orders Extract rate constants Predict reaction progress 2.10 Beyond First-Order Kinetics While unimolecular decomposition provides a straightforward example of kinetic analysis, many reactions follow more complex rate laws. In the next chapter, we’ll explore systematic methods for: Deriving integrated rate laws from proposed mechanisms Testing kinetic models against experimental data Building evidence for reaction mechanisms These tools form an essential framework for understanding chemical reactivity across a broad range of systems.

In our previous lecture, we examined unimolecular decomposition reactions, starting with experimental data that showed exponential decay in concentration. By proposing an exponential model and differentiating, we demonstrated consistency with first-order kinetics—a mathematical signature of unimolecular mechanisms. While illuminating, this approach relied heavily on choosing the correct model function. Different functions with similar shapes would have yielded different rate laws upon differentiation, potentially inconsistent with the known unimolecular mechanism. This highlights a key limitation of working from data to mechanism. # Insert comparison diagram from slides 3.2 Systematic Kinetic Analysis In practice, kinetic analysis typically proceeds in the opposite direction: Propose a plausible reaction mechanism Write down the corresponding differential rate law Integrate this rate law to obtain an integrated rate law Compare this integrated rate law with experimental data This systematic approach provides a rigorous test of mechanistic hypotheses. When experimental data match our derived integrated rate law, we have evidence supporting our proposed mechanism. Equally importantly, when they don’t match, we can conclusively reject that mechanism and must consider alternatives. 3.3 Simple Integrated Rate Laws We focus here on simple integrated rate laws—those corresponding to single-step reaction mechanisms. For any such mechanism, our analysis follows these steps: Propose a single-step mechanism Write the differential rate law Integrate to obtain the integrated rate law Rearrange into linear form Compare with experimental data # Insert flowchart from slides The linear form proves particularly useful because it allows straightforward graphical analysis: if experimental data plotted in this form give a straight line, the data are consistent with our proposed mechanism. 3.4 Zeroth-Order Kinetics For a zeroth-order mechanism, where rate is independent of concentration: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\] To obtain the integrated rate law: Rearrange into integral form: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Rearrange to obtain the integrated rate law: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This is already in linear form. This equation tells us that if our reaction follows zeroth-order kinetics, then a plot \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) should give a straight line with slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plot from slides 3.5 First-Order Kinetics For a unimolecular mechanism: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Express as the integrated rate law: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.6 Second-Order Kinetics For a bimolecular mechanism with identical molecules: \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]}]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt\\] Rearrange to give integrated rate law: \\[\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(k\\) and intercept = \\(1/[A]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.7 More Complex Second-Order Processes For reactions between different species (A + B → P): \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Integration is more complex due to the two-variable dependence: Use stoichiometric relationships: If \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\neq [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\), then \\([\\mathrm{B}] - [\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) = constant Let \\([\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - ([\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}])\\) Substitute and integrate to obtain: \\[kt = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]/[\\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\\mathrm{A}]/[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\right)\\] # Insert diagram from slides 3.7.1 Pseudo-First-Order Conditions When one reactant is in large excess (e.g., \\([\\mathrm{A}] \\gg [\\mathrm{B}]\\)): \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) remains effectively constant 2 .

While theoretical understanding of reaction mechanisms can suggest potential rate laws, ultimately we must determine these laws empirically through careful analysis of kinetic data. In this chapter, we explore four complementary methods for extracting rate law information from concentration-time measurements. 4.2 The Integral Method 4.2.1 Theoretical Background As we saw in Lecture 3, different rate laws lead to different integrated rate laws, each predicting distinct functional forms for the time evolution of reactant concentrations. This provides a powerful method for determining rate laws: we can compare experimental concentration-time data against these predicted functional forms. The standard method involves transforming the integrated rate laws into linear form. The key relationships are summarised below: Order Rate Law Integrated Rate Law Linear Form 0 \\(\\nu = \\color{660099}{k}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 1 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-kt}\\) \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 2 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\) By plotting experimental data in these linear forms, we can readily identify which rate law best describes our reaction. 4.2.2 Example: Testing for Second-Order Kinetics Consider experimental data showing the decay of reactant A. To test whether these data are consistent with second-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t}\\) versus \\(t\\). A straight line would indicate consistency with second-order kinetics, with slope \\(k\\) and intercept \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\). 4.2.3 Example: Decomposition of Azomethane The decomposition of azomethane was studied at a pressure of \\(2.18 \\times 10^4\\) Pa and temperature of 576 K, yielding the following concentration-time data: \\(t\\) / minutes 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) / \\(10^{-3}\\) mol dm\\(^{-3}\\) 8.70 6.52 4.89 3.67 2.75 2.06 1.55 To test for first-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\ln[\\text{azomethane}]\\) versus \\(t\\). The resulting linear plot (with slope \\(-k = -9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\) min\\(^{-1}\\)) confirms first-order behaviour. 4.2.4 A Note on Modern Analysis Methods While we have focused on analysing concentration-time data using linear transformations, this is not the only approach. Modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original form. However, the linear analysis method presented here remains valuable both for understanding the mathematical relationships involved and for providing a straightforward way to identify compatible rate laws from experimental data. 4.3 The Half-Life Method 4.3.1 Characteristic Exponential Decay First-order kinetics corresponds to characteristic exponential decay, where the concentration decreases by the same proportion in any fixed time interval. This leads to a key diagnostic: if we examine the time taken for the concentration to fall to \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of its initial value (where \\(n\\) is any number), this time interval remains constant throughout the reaction. The “half-life” (\\(t_{1/2}\\)) represents the special case where \\(n = 2\\), but there is nothing unique about this choice. For a first-order reaction: \\[t_{1/n} = \\frac{\\ln(n)}{k}\\] 4.3.2 Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited Returning to our azomethane data, we can verify first-order kinetics by showing that successive time intervals required for the concentration to halve remain constant. From the data: Time interval Initial [A] Final [A] Δt First half-life 8.70 4.35 72.3 Second half-life 4.35 2.18 72.3 The constant half-life provides independent confirmation of first-order kinetics. 4.4 The Isolation Method For reactions involving multiple reactants, the isolation method allows us to determine partial reaction orders by artificially simplifying the kinetics. By using a large excess of all but one reactant, their concentrations remain effectively constant throughout the reaction. Consider our bimolecular reaction: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta\\] If \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) then \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) and: \\[\\nu = k^\\prime[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha\\] where \\(k^\\prime = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0^\\beta\\) is a pseudo-rate constant. To determine \\(\\beta\\), we can repeat the experiment with different initial concentrations of B: \\[\\ln k^\\prime = \\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln k^\\prime\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\beta\\). 4.5 The Differential Method The differential method works directly with reaction rates rather than integrated concentration profiles. Taking logarithms of the rate law: \\[\\ln\\nu = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}] + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]\\] Using initial rates with varying starting concentrations: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] When \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) is held constant: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = (\\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0) + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln\\nu_0\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\alpha\\). 4.6 Summary These four methods provide complementary approaches to rate law determination: The integral method compares experimental data against predicted concentration-time profiles The half-life method identifies first-order behaviour through time interval analysis The isolation method simplifies complex kinetics to determine partial orders The differential method uses initial rates to directly determine reaction orders Each method has particular strengths and limitations. The choice of method often depends on the specific reaction system and available experimental data.
