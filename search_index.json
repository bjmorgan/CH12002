Chemistry is fundamentally concerned with change—the transformation of substances into new forms with different properties. When we mix reactants together, we want to know not just whether a reaction will occur, but how rapidly it will proceed. While thermodynamics provides powerful tools for determining whether a particular chemical change is favourable and what the final equilibrium composition will be, it tells us nothing about how quickly this equilibrium will be reached. A reaction may be thermodynamically favourable yet proceed so slowly that it appears not to happen at all. Consider the conversion of diamond to graphite—thermodynamically spontaneous at room temperature and pressure, yet the process occurs at such a negligible rate that diamonds remain stable for geological timescales. Conversely, some reactions reach equilibrium in fractions of a second. Chemical kinetics addresses these questions of reaction rates and mechanisms. Where thermodynamics concerns itself with the energy relationships that govern chemical equilibria, kinetics focuses on the rates of chemical processes and the molecular pathways by which they occur. Through kinetic analysis, we can determine how quickly reactants transform into products, what factors influence reaction speed, and what sequence of molecular events constitutes the reaction mechanism. The complementary nature of thermodynamics and kinetics provides a complete picture of chemical change: Thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction can occur and what the equilibrium state will be Kinetics tells us how fast we approach that equilibrium and by what molecular pathway Both perspectives are essential for understanding chemical processes—in laboratory settings, industrial applications, and natural systems. 1.2 Describing How Concentrations Change with Time Let us examine a simple reaction: the conversion of a reactant A into a product B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations of both species change. We track the progress of the reaction by monitoring concentrations as functions of time. Using square brackets to denote concentration (in mol dm\\(^{-3}\\)), we write these time-dependent concentrations as \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\). Starting from initial values at \\(t = 0\\), the system evolves toward its final state. The questions we might ask include: How much product B is present after time \\(t\\)? How long will it take for a certain percentage of A to convert to B? If we change pressure, temperature, or initial concentration, how will the reaction speed be affected? Answering these questions requires us to understand how reaction rates relate to concentrations—and this is the central concern of chemical kinetics. 1.3 Reaction Rates We quantify how quickly a reaction occurs in terms of the rate at which concentrations change with time. For our simple A → B reaction, the reaction rate can be expressed as either the rate of disappearance of A or the rate of appearance of B. 1.3.1 Defining the Rate If the rate were constant, calculating it would be straightforward—we would simply measure the change in concentration over a time interval: \\[\\text{change in [A] per unit time} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_{t_2} - [\\mathrm{A}]_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1} = \\frac{\\Delta[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\Delta t}\\] In most cases, however, reaction rates are not constant—they change as the reaction progresses and reactant concentrations decrease. To capture the instantaneous rate at any moment, we use the derivative: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] The negative sign in the first expression ensures that the rate is a positive quantity, since \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) decreases with time (giving a negative derivative). By convention, reaction rates are always expressed as positive values. 1.3.2 Stoichiometric Factors For reactions with more complex stoichiometry, the relationship between concentration changes requires appropriate stoichiometric factors. Consider a reaction where one molecule of A combines with two molecules of B to form one molecule of C: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] Here, B is consumed twice as rapidly as A. To define a single, unambiguous reaction rate, we include stoichiometric factors: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, for a reaction with stoichiometry \\[\\nu_\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{A} + \\nu_\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{B} + \\ldots \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{P} + \\nu_\\mathrm{Q}\\mathrm{Q} + \\ldots\\] the rate is written as: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{A}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{B}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\ldots = +\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{P}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{Q}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Q}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\ldots\\] But where do these stoichiometric factors come from? The answer lies in a fundamental principle: the conservation of mass. 1.4 Mass Balance Chemical reactions cannot create or destroy mass—they merely rearrange atoms into new configurations. This principle of mass conservation provides the foundation for understanding how the rates of change of different species are connected. 1.4.1 A Simple Case: A → B Consider our simple reaction A → B. If each molecule of A converts into exactly one molecule of B, then at any time \\(t\\) the total number of molecules (and hence the total concentration) remains constant: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] If we start with pure A (so that \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\)), this simplifies to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to time: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] since the initial concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) is a constant. Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This tells us that for this simple reaction, the rate of formation of B exactly equals the rate of consumption of A. 1.4.2 When Stoichiometry Differs: A → 2B Now consider a reaction where one molecule of A produces two molecules of B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{B}\\] Here, conservation of mass does not imply conservation of moles—we gain one mole of molecules for every mole of A that reacts. To write a mass balance, we note that each A molecule that reacts produces two B molecules. If we define our “conserved quantity” in terms of B-equivalents, then one A is worth two B, giving: \\[2[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = 2[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Taking the derivative: \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This confirms that B is produced twice as fast as A is consumed—exactly what we expect from the stoichiometry. To define a single reaction rate that is independent of which species we monitor, we write: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] 1.4.3 The General Result For any reaction, mass balance leads to the general expression: \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species X (negative for reactants, positive for products). This relationship ensures that the reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) has the same numerical value regardless of which species we use to measure it. The units of reaction rate are concentration per unit time: mol dm\\(^{-3}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\). 1.5 Rate Laws The rates of chemical reactions typically depend on the concentrations of the reactants. The mathematical relationship between concentrations and rate is called a rate law. 1.5.1 Simple Rate Laws Many reactions follow a simple rate law where the rate is proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to some power: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b[\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots\\] This expression contains several important quantities. The proportionality factor \\(k\\) is called the rate constant; it depends on temperature but not on concentration. The exponents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), etc. are called the order of reaction with respect to reactants A, B, C, etc., and their sum \\((a + b + c + \\ldots)\\) is the overall reaction order. Note that orders need not be integers—they can be zero, fractional, or even negative. 1.5.2 Orders Need Not Match Stoichiometry An important point: the orders in a rate law need not reflect the stoichiometry of the overall reaction equation. For example: \\[\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{I}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HI} \\qquad \\nu = k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{I}_2]\\] Here the orders (both 1) happen to match the stoichiometric coefficients. But consider: \\[3\\mathrm{ClO}^- \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ClO}_3^- + 2\\mathrm{Cl}^- \\qquad \\nu = k[\\mathrm{ClO}^-]^2\\] The stoichiometric coefficient of ClO\\(^-\\) is 3, but the reaction is second order in ClO\\(^-\\). 1.5.3 Complex Rate Laws Some reactions exhibit rate laws that cannot be written in the simple power-law form. A classic example is the formation of hydrogen bromide: \\[\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr} \\qquad \\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1/2}}{1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}\\] This reaction is first order with respect to H\\(_2\\), but the orders with respect to Br\\(_2\\) and HBr are undefined in the usual sense. The appearance of the product HBr in the denominator indicates that the product actually inhibits the reaction—a phenomenon we will explore later in the course. A complex rate law always implies a multistep reaction mechanism. 1.6 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of simple molecular-level steps called elementary processes (or elementary reactions). An elementary process represents a single molecular event—a transformation that cannot be broken down further. 1.6.1 Molecularity The molecularity of an elementary process describes how many reactant molecules participate in that single step. A unimolecular process involves a single molecule undergoing transformation—for example, isomerisation or decomposition. A bimolecular process requires two molecules to collide and react. Termolecular processes, where three molecules must collide simultaneously, are rare. Termolecular processes are rare because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very low. When apparent third-order kinetics are observed, the mechanism usually involves sequential bimolecular steps rather than a true termolecular collision. 1.6.2 Elementary Processes Have Simple Rate Laws For elementary processes—and only for elementary processes—the rate law directly reflects the molecularity: Molecularity Example Rate Law Unimolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\) Bimolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\) Bimolecular \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\) Termolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\) This direct correspondence between molecularity and reaction order holds because an elementary process represents an actual molecular event. The rate depends on how frequently the required molecular encounters occur. For a unimolecular process, the rate depends only on how many A molecules are present. For a bimolecular process, the rate depends on how often A and B molecules collide—which is proportional to both \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\). 1.7 Complex Reactions Most reactions we encounter are not elementary processes but rather sequences of elementary steps. The H\\(_2\\) + Br\\(_2\\) reaction, for example, proceeds through a mechanism involving four elementary steps: \\(\\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br}\\) (unimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) (bimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) (bimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}_2\\) (bimolecular) Each elementary step follows a simple rate law determined by its molecularity. The overall rate law for the complex reaction emerges from how these steps combine—and this is why the overall rate law can be complicated. For complex reactions, we cannot deduce the rate law from the reaction stoichiometry alone. Rate laws for complex reactions must be determined empirically through analysis of experimental data. However, as we shall see, if we know (or hypothesise) the mechanism, we can predict the rate law—and comparing this prediction with experiment provides evidence for or against the proposed mechanism. 1.8 Units of the Rate Constant The units of a rate constant depend on the overall order of the reaction. Since both sides of a rate equation must have the same dimensions, we can deduce the units of \\(k\\) from dimensional analysis. 1.8.1 First-Order Reactions For a first-order reaction (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)): \\[\\underbrace{\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1}}_{\\text{rate}} = [k] \\times \\underbrace{\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}}_{[\\mathrm{A}]}\\] Solving for \\([k]\\): \\[[k] = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\] 1.8.2 Second-Order Reactions For a second-order reaction (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)): \\[\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1} = [k] \\times \\mathrm{mol}^2\\mathrm{\\,dm}^{-6}\\] \\[[k] = \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\mathrm{\\,dm}^{3}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1}\\] 1.8.3 Third-Order Reactions For a third-order reaction (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^3\\)): \\[[k] = \\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\\mathrm{\\,dm}^{6}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1}\\] 1.8.4 General Pattern For a reaction of overall order \\(n\\), the rate constant has units: \\[[k] = \\mathrm{mol}^{1-n}\\mathrm{\\,dm}^{3(n-1)}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1}\\] This pattern reflects the fundamental relationship between reaction order and the dimensions needed to make the rate equation dimensionally consistent. When comparing rate constants, always check that they refer to the same order of reaction—a rate constant of 10\\(^6\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) for a first-order reaction cannot be directly compared with a rate constant of 10\\(^6\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\) dm\\(^3\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) for a second-order reaction. 1.9 Looking Ahead In this lecture, we have established the foundations of chemical kinetics: how to describe concentration changes, define reaction rates, and write rate laws. We have seen that mass balance provides the physical basis for the stoichiometric factors in rate expressions, and that elementary processes—the molecular-level steps of a reaction—follow simple rate laws determined by their molecularity. The relationship between concentration profiles and reaction rates—connected through differentiation and integration—will be central to our analysis throughout this course. In the next lecture, we will derive integrated rate laws that allow us to predict how concentrations evolve over time for reactions of different orders, and compare these predictions with experimental data.

While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes. When we measure reactant and product concentrations over time, we observe characteristic concentration profiles like those shown in Figure 1. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, the reactant concentration decreases exponentially while the product concentration rises in a complementary fashion. The instantaneous reaction rate at any point equals the gradient of the tangent to these concentration curves, providing our best linear estimate of the rate at that specific moment: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\text{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] 2.2 Elementary Processes and Rate Laws For elementary processes (single-step reactions), rate laws directly reflect reaction molecularity. Consider these common examples: Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]\\] Bimolecular reaction: \\[\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}][\\text{B}]\\] Bimolecular reaction (identical reactants): \\[2\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{P} \\quad \\nu = k[\\text{A}]^2\\] 2.3 Building and Testing Kinetic Models Consider a unimolecular decomposition reaction where each molecule has a constant probability of reaction per unit time: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c\\] This molecular picture suggests an exponential decay model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] Taking the natural logarithm transforms this into a linear relationship: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] The linear fit in Figure 4 confirms our first-order kinetic model. Differentiating our concentration expression reveals the underlying rate law: \\[\\begin{align*} \\nu &amp;= -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda[\\text{A}] \\end{align*}\\] This analysis demonstrates that: The reaction follows first-order kinetics The decay constant \\(\\lambda\\) equals the rate constant \\(k\\) \\(k\\) quantifies the molecular-scale reaction probability 2.4 Connecting Mechanisms to Observable Kinetics More complex reaction mechanisms generate distinct kinetic signatures.

By carefully analyzing kinetic data, we can: Validate proposed mechanisms Determine reaction orders Extract rate constants Predict reaction progress 2.5 Kinetic Data as a Window into Reaction Mechanisms Understanding how chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level presents a fundamental challenge in physical chemistry. While we cannot directly observe individual molecular collisions and transformations, careful analysis of reaction kinetics provides powerful insights into these microscopic processes. By measuring how reactant and product concentrations change over time, we can test hypothetical reaction mechanisms and build deeper understanding of chemical reactivity. 2.6 Principles of Rate Law Analysis When analyzing reaction kinetics, we typically begin with time-resolved measurements of reactant and product concentrations. For a simple decomposition reaction A → B, these data reveal characteristic concentration profiles: an exponential decay of reactant A matched by a complementary rise in product B. The mathematical relationship between these profiles and the underlying molecular processes forms the foundation of chemical kinetics. Consider a hypothetical unimolecular decomposition reaction. At the molecular level, each molecule of A has some probability of converting to B in any given time interval. This microscopic behavior manifests in measurable changes in bulk concentration. The connection between these molecular events and macroscopic observations lies at the heart of kinetic analysis. 2.7 Building a Kinetic Model To understand this connection quantitatively, we can construct a molecular simulation that captures the essential physics of unimolecular decomposition: \\[P(\\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B}) = c \\quad \\text{per molecule per unit time}\\] This simple probability rule generates concentration profiles that closely match experimental observations. From these profiles, we can extract key kinetic parameters that characterize the reaction. The mathematical framework for analyzing these data begins with a proposed kinetic model: \\[[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t}\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) represents a decay constant characteristic of the reaction. Taking the natural logarithm transforms this exponential relationship into a linear form: \\[\\ln[\\text{A}] = \\ln[\\text{A}]_0 - \\lambda t\\] This transformation provides a straightforward method for testing the model against experimental data — a linear relationship between \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\(t\\) supports first-order kinetics. 2.8 From Model to Mechanism The proposed kinetic model implies a specific rate law, which we can derive through differentiation: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]_0e^{-\\lambda t} = \\lambda[\\text{A}]\\] This result reveals three important insights: The reaction rate depends linearly on reactant concentration The decay constant \\(\\lambda\\) corresponds to the rate constant \\(k\\) The reaction follows first-order kinetics These findings align perfectly with our molecular picture of unimolecular decomposition, where each molecule reacts independently with constant probability. The rate constant \\(k\\), typically measured in s-1, quantifies this probability. 2.9 The Role of Integrated Rate Laws The expression we derived for \\([\\mathrm{A}](t)\\) represents an integrated rate law — the mathematical solution to our differential rate equation. This relationship between concentration and time provides a crucial bridge between experimental measurements and molecular mechanisms. Through careful analysis of kinetic data, we can: Validate proposed reaction mechanisms Determine reaction orders Extract rate constants Predict reaction progress 2.10 Beyond First-Order Kinetics While unimolecular decomposition provides a straightforward example of kinetic analysis, many reactions follow more complex rate laws. In the next chapter, we’ll explore systematic methods for: Deriving integrated rate laws from proposed mechanisms Testing kinetic models against experimental data Building evidence for reaction mechanisms These tools form an essential framework for understanding chemical reactivity across a broad range of systems.

In our previous lecture, we examined unimolecular decomposition reactions, starting with experimental data that showed exponential decay in concentration. By proposing an exponential model and differentiating, we demonstrated consistency with first-order kinetics—a mathematical signature of unimolecular mechanisms. While illuminating, this approach relied heavily on choosing the correct model function. Different functions with similar shapes would have yielded different rate laws upon differentiation, potentially inconsistent with the known unimolecular mechanism. This highlights a key limitation of working from data to mechanism. # Insert comparison diagram from slides 3.2 Systematic Kinetic Analysis In practice, kinetic analysis typically proceeds in the opposite direction: Propose a plausible reaction mechanism Write down the corresponding differential rate law Integrate this rate law to obtain an integrated rate law Compare this integrated rate law with experimental data This systematic approach provides a rigorous test of mechanistic hypotheses. When experimental data match our derived integrated rate law, we have evidence supporting our proposed mechanism. Equally importantly, when they don’t match, we can conclusively reject that mechanism and must consider alternatives. 3.3 Simple Integrated Rate Laws We focus here on simple integrated rate laws—those corresponding to single-step reaction mechanisms. For any such mechanism, our analysis follows these steps: Propose a single-step mechanism Write the differential rate law Integrate to obtain the integrated rate law Rearrange into linear form Compare with experimental data # Insert flowchart from slides The linear form proves particularly useful because it allows straightforward graphical analysis: if experimental data plotted in this form give a straight line, the data are consistent with our proposed mechanism. 3.4 Zeroth-Order Kinetics For a zeroth-order mechanism, where rate is independent of concentration: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\] To obtain the integrated rate law: Rearrange into integral form: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Rearrange to obtain the integrated rate law: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This is already in linear form. This equation tells us that if our reaction follows zeroth-order kinetics, then a plot \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) should give a straight line with slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plot from slides 3.5 First-Order Kinetics For a unimolecular mechanism: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Express as the integrated rate law: \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(-k\\) and intercept = \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.6 Second-Order Kinetics For a bimolecular mechanism with identical molecules: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\] Separate variables: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Set up integral equation: \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrate both sides: \\[[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]}]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = [-kt]_0^t\\] Apply limits: \\[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt\\] Rearrange to give integrated rate law: \\[\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\] This linear form shows that plotting \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) versus \\(t\\) gives slope = \\(k\\) and intercept = \\(1/[A]_0\\). # Insert plots from slides 3.7 More Complex Second-Order Processes For reactions between different species (A + B → P): \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Integration is more complex due to the two-variable dependence: Use stoichiometric relationships: If \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\neq [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\), then \\([\\mathrm{B}] - [\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) = constant Let \\([\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - ([\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}])\\) Substitute and integrate to obtain: \\[kt = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]/[\\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\\mathrm{A}]/[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\right)\\] # Insert diagram from slides 3.7.1 Pseudo-First-Order Conditions When one reactant is in large excess (e.g., \\([\\mathrm{A}] \\gg [\\mathrm{B}]\\)): \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) remains effectively constant 2 .

While theoretical understanding of reaction mechanisms can suggest potential rate laws, ultimately we must determine these laws empirically through careful analysis of kinetic data. In this chapter, we explore four complementary methods for extracting rate law information from concentration-time measurements. 4.2 The Integral Method 4.2.1 Theoretical Background As we saw in Lecture 3, different rate laws lead to different integrated rate laws, each predicting distinct functional forms for the time evolution of reactant concentrations. This provides a powerful method for determining rate laws: we can compare experimental concentration-time data against these predicted functional forms. The standard method involves transforming the integrated rate laws into linear form. The key relationships are summarised below: Order Rate Law Integrated Rate Law Linear Form 0 \\(\\nu = \\color{660099}{k}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 1 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-kt}\\) \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) 2 \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\) By plotting experimental data in these linear forms, we can readily identify which rate law best describes our reaction. 4.2.2 Example: Testing for Second-Order Kinetics Consider experimental data showing the decay of reactant A. To test whether these data are consistent with second-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t}\\) versus \\(t\\). A straight line would indicate consistency with second-order kinetics, with slope \\(k\\) and intercept \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\). 4.2.3 Example: Decomposition of Azomethane The decomposition of azomethane was studied at a pressure of \\(2.18 \\times 10^4\\) Pa and temperature of 576 K, yielding the following concentration-time data: \\(t\\) / minutes 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) / \\(10^{-3}\\) mol dm\\(^{-3}\\) 8.70 6.52 4.89 3.67 2.75 2.06 1.55 To test for first-order kinetics, we plot \\(\\ln[\\text{azomethane}]\\) versus \\(t\\). The resulting linear plot (with slope \\(-k = -9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\) min\\(^{-1}\\)) confirms first-order behaviour. 4.2.4 A Note on Modern Analysis Methods While we have focused on analysing concentration-time data using linear transformations, this is not the only approach. Modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original form. However, the linear analysis method presented here remains valuable both for understanding the mathematical relationships involved and for providing a straightforward way to identify compatible rate laws from experimental data. 4.3 The Half-Life Method 4.3.1 Characteristic Exponential Decay First-order kinetics corresponds to characteristic exponential decay, where the concentration decreases by the same proportion in any fixed time interval. This leads to a key diagnostic: if we examine the time taken for the concentration to fall to \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of its initial value (where \\(n\\) is any number), this time interval remains constant throughout the reaction. The “half-life” (\\(t_{1/2}\\)) represents the special case where \\(n = 2\\), but there is nothing unique about this choice. For a first-order reaction: \\[t_{1/n} = \\frac{\\ln(n)}{k}\\] 4.3.2 Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited Returning to our azomethane data, we can verify first-order kinetics by showing that successive time intervals required for the concentration to halve remain constant. From the data: Time interval Initial [A] Final [A] Δt First half-life 8.70 4.35 72.3 Second half-life 4.35 2.18 72.3 The constant half-life provides independent confirmation of first-order kinetics. 4.4 The Isolation Method For reactions involving multiple reactants, the isolation method allows us to determine partial reaction orders by artificially simplifying the kinetics. By using a large excess of all but one reactant, their concentrations remain effectively constant throughout the reaction. Consider our bimolecular reaction: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta\\] If \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) then \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) and: \\[\\nu = k^\\prime[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha\\] where \\(k^\\prime = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0^\\beta\\) is a pseudo-rate constant. To determine \\(\\beta\\), we can repeat the experiment with different initial concentrations of B: \\[\\ln k^\\prime = \\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln k^\\prime\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\beta\\). 4.5 The Differential Method The differential method works directly with reaction rates rather than integrated concentration profiles. Taking logarithms of the rate law: \\[\\ln\\nu = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}] + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]\\] Using initial rates with varying starting concentrations: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] When \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) is held constant: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = (\\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0) + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln\\nu_0\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) gives slope \\(\\alpha\\). 4.6 Summary These four methods provide complementary approaches to rate law determination: The integral method compares experimental data against predicted concentration-time profiles The half-life method identifies first-order behaviour through time interval analysis The isolation method simplifies complex kinetics to determine partial orders The differential method uses initial rates to directly determine reaction orders Each method has particular strengths and limitations. The choice of method often depends on the specific reaction system and available experimental data.

Understanding how these complex reaction mechanisms give rise to experimentally observed kinetic behavior requires careful analysis of each step and consideration of how these steps work together to control the overall reaction rate. 5.2 Consecutive Reactions Consider the following reaction mechanism that consists of two elementary steps and proceeds through a single intermediate B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] This type of reaction sequence, where one product becomes the reactant for a subsequent step, is called a consecutive reaction. To analyze the kinetics, we need to write differential rate equations for each species: For reactant A: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] For intermediate B: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] For product C: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] # Plot showing [A], [B], and [C] versus time 5.2.1 Solving the Rate Equations Starting with the initial conditions at \\(t = 0\\): - \\([\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) - \\([\\mathrm{B}] = 0\\) - \\([\\mathrm{C}] = 0\\) We can solve these equations step by step: First, the equation for A is a simple first-order decay: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Which integrates to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-k_1t}\\] For B, we substitute this result: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + k_2[\\mathrm{B}] = k_1[\\mathrm{A}]_0e^{-k_1t}\\] This is a linear first-order differential equation. Its solution is: \\[[\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{k_1}{k_2-k_1}[\\mathrm{A}]_0(e^{-k_1t} - e^{-k_2t})\\] For C, we can use conservation of mass: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\] Substituting gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1 + \\frac{k_1e^{-k_2t} - k_2e^{-k_1t}}{k_2-k_1}\\right)\\] 5.2.2 Rate-Determining Step In consecutive reactions, one step often proceeds much more slowly than the others, effectively controlling the overall reaction rate. This rate-determining step emerges naturally from the mathematical analysis of the reaction kinetics. When analyzing concentration profiles for consecutive reactions, two limiting cases arise depending on the relative magnitudes of \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\): When \\(k_1 \\gg k_2\\): # Plot showing case where k1 &gt;&gt; k2 B builds up quickly then decays slowly The slow second step is rate-determining \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-e^{-k_2t})\\) When \\(k_1 \\ll k_2\\): # Plot showing case where k1 &lt;&lt; k2 B remains at low concentration The slow first step is rate-determining \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-e^{-k_1t})\\) 5.3 Equilibrium Reactions Many reactions reach a dynamic equilibrium rather than proceeding to completion: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B}\\] The rate equations are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] At equilibrium, concentrations no longer change, so the net rates become zero: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] This condition gives: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}] = k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = K_\\mathrm{eq}\\] This important result connects kinetics (rate constants) with thermodynamics (equilibrium constant). 5.4 Pre-equilibrium Mechanisms Some reactions establish a rapid equilibrium between reactants and an intermediate before slowly converting to products. A common example is acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis: \\(\\ce{CH3COOCH3 + H3O+ &lt;=&gt; CH3COOCH4+ + H2O}\\) (fast equilibrium) \\(\\ce{CH3COOCH4+ + H2O -&gt; CH3COOH + CH3OH + H3O+}\\) (slow) This behavior, called a pre-equilibrium mechanism, occurs when: - The forward and reverse rates of the first step are much faster than the second step - The first step reaches equilibrium before significant product formation - The overall rate depends on both the equilibrium constant and the rate of the second step In general terms, a pre-equilibrium mechanism has the form: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] The rate equations are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] When \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\), the first step rapidly reaches equilibrium: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{C}]}{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = K\\] This gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] The overall rate becomes: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}] = k_2K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{k_2k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] # Plot showing pre-equilibrium kinetics This second-order rate law emerges from a more complex mechanism through the pre-equilibrium approximation. The overall rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_2k_1/k_{-1}\\) combines the individual rate constants from each step in the mechanism.

However, for many reactions, the complete kinetic analysis becomes mathematically intractable. In cases where the reaction intermediates are highly reactive and are quickly converted into products, we can apply a simplifying approximation called the Steady State Approximation, which often allows us to simplify the differential rate equations to derive an approximate mathematical description of the overall reaction rate. Consider a reaction pathway involving a reactive intermediate B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] The concentration of intermediate B changes through three competing processes: - Formation from reactant A (rate \\(k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\)) - Back-reaction to A (rate \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\)) - Forward reaction to product C (rate \\(k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\)) # Figure showing competing processes affecting [B] # - Blue arrow showing formation from A # - Red arrow showing back-reaction to A # - Green arrow showing conversion to C Under steady state conditions, the intermediate’s concentration remains approximately constant because its rate of formation equals its rate of consumption. Mathematically, this means: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0\\] This approximation doesn’t imply that [B] = 0, but rather that [B] rapidly reaches and maintains a nearly constant value throughout most of the reaction. 6.2 Analysis of Pre-equilibrium Systems Let’s examine a mechanism involving both equilibrium and steady state behavior: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] The complete set of rate equations for this system is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\end{align*}\\] # Plot showing concentration profiles over time # - [A] and [B] decreasing # - [C] reaching steady state rapidly # - [D] increasing as product forms 6.2.1 Application of the Steady State Approximation We apply the steady state approximation to intermediate C: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\approx 0\\] This equation can be rearranged: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[\\mathrm{C}]\\] Solving for [C]: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\] The overall reaction rate becomes: \\[\\begin{align*} \\nu &amp;= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ &amp;= k_2\\left(\\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k_2k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\end{align*}\\] 6.2.2 Analysis of Limiting Cases Two important limiting behaviors emerge from this rate law: Pre-equilibrium Limit (\\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\)): \\[\\nu = \\frac{k_2k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] The reaction exhibits second-order kinetics with an effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{eff} = k_2k_1/k_{-1}\\). Rate-determining Step Limit (\\(k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\gg k_{-1}\\)): \\[\\nu = k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] The reaction shows first-order kinetics with rate constant \\(k_1\\). # Side-by-side plots comparing concentration profiles # Left: Pre-equilibrium case # Right: Rate-determining step case 6.3 Mathematical Foundation of Steady State Behavior Consider a general reaction system where an intermediate species I is: - Produced with rate \\(\\nu_f\\) - Consumed with rate proportional to [I] The rate equation is: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\nu_f - k[\\mathrm{I}]\\] This linear first-order differential equation has the solution: \\[[\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{k}(1 - e^{-kt})\\] This solution shows that: 1. [I] approaches steady state value \\(\\nu_f/k\\) exponentially 2. Characteristic time to reach steady state is \\(1/k\\) 3.

A classic example is the thermal decomposition of azomethane: \\[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_6} + \\mathrm{N_2}\\] At high pressures, this reaction exhibits first-order kinetics: \\[-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]\\] This simple rate law presents us with a fundamental mechanistic puzzle when we examine the molecular-level implications. We observe two seemingly contradictory behaviours: The reaction shows first-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)), suggesting each molecule reacts independently. The rate increases with temperature, indicating that energy is required to overcome an activation barrier. But how does each molecule acquire this activation energy? If the activation energy came from molecular collisions (the usual mechanism for thermal activation), we would expect the rate to depend on the frequency of these collisions. Since collision frequency is proportional to the concentration of both colliding species, this would lead to second-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)). Yet we observe first-order behaviour. This puzzle suggests that a more complex mechanism must be at work - one that can explain both the thermal activation and the first-order kinetics. 7.1.1 The Lindemann Mechanism In 1921, Frederick Lindemann proposed a three-step mechanism to explain this behaviour: Excitation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Deactivation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{P}\\] Here, M represents any collision partner (often the reactant molecule itself), and A* represents an energetically excited molecule. 7.1.2 Mathematical Analysis We can apply the steady-state approximation to the excited intermediate A*: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A^*}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A^*}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}] = 0\\] Solving for [A*]: \\[[\\mathrm{A^*}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2}\\] The overall reaction rate is determined by the decomposition of A*: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}] = \\frac{k_1k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2}\\] For the specific case of azomethane decomposition, where M = CH3N2CH3: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_1k_2[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]^2}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] + k_2}\\] 7.1.3 High-Pressure Limit At high pressures, collisional deactivation is much faster than unimolecular decomposition (\\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] \\gg k_2\\)). Under these conditions: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]\\] This simplifies to first-order kinetics with an effective rate constant \\(k = \\frac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\\), explaining the observed behaviour. 7.1.4 Low-Pressure Limit Conversely, at low pressures where \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}] \\ll k_2\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C_2H_6}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]^2\\] The reaction shows second-order kinetics with \\(k = k_1\\). This prediction was experimentally verified in 1927, providing strong support for the Lindemann mechanism. 7.2 Third-Order Reactions Some reactions exhibit third-order kinetics, such as the oxidation of nitric oxide: \\[2\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] with rate law: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{NO_2}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}]\\] 7.2.1 Mechanistic Implications A simple termolecular collision mechanism seems implausible - simultaneous three-body collisions are extremely rare. Moreover, the reaction rate decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting a more complex mechanism. An alternative mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium better explains these observations: \\[\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{NO} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} (\\mathrm{NO})_2\\] \\[(\\mathrm{NO})_2 + \\mathrm{O_2} \\xrightarrow{k_2} 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] At equilibrium: \\[K = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{[(\\mathrm{NO})_2]}{[\\mathrm{NO}]^2}\\] The overall rate: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{NO_2}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2k_2[(\\mathrm{NO})_2][\\mathrm{O_2}] = 2k_2K[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}]\\] This mechanism explains both the observed third-order kinetics and the negative temperature dependence (as the pre-equilibrium favours dissociation at higher temperatures). 7.3 Formation of Ozone Another important third-order reaction is ozone formation: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3}\\] This reaction exhibits third-order kinetics with the rate law: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{O_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{O}][\\mathrm{O_2}][\\mathrm{M}]\\] where M represents a third body (typically another gas molecule like N2 or O2). 7.3.1 Why a Third Body is Necessary The requirement for a third body arises from two critical factors: High Exothermicity: The formation of ozone is highly exothermic, releasing approximately 107 kJ/mol when the new O-O bond forms. This substantial energy release creates a vibrationally excited ozone molecule (O3*). Momentum Conservation Constraints: When an O atom collides with an O2 molecule, the laws of momentum conservation severely restrict how the released energy can be distributed. Consider a head-on collision: For a simple bimolecular collision, both momentum and energy must be conserved: \\[m_\\mathrm{O}v_\\mathrm{O} + m_\\mathrm{O_2}v_\\mathrm{O_2} = m_\\mathrm{O_3}v_\\mathrm{O_3}\\] The conservation of momentum forces much of the released energy into the internal vibrational modes of the O3 molecule rather than translational motion. This leads to a highly excited O3* that rapidly dissociates back to O + O2 unless the excess energy can be removed. This is where the third body (M) becomes essential. When the vibrationally excited O3* collides with M, the excess energy can be transferred away, allowing the ozone molecule to stabilize: # Insert diagram showing energy transfer to third body The reaction therefore proceeds through two steps: Formation of excited ozone: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{O_3^*}\\] Collisional stabilisation: \\[\\mathrm{O_3^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Applying a pre-equilibrium approximation to this mechanism yields the observed third-order kinetics: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{O_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{O}][\\mathrm{O_2}][\\mathrm{M}]\\] 7.3.2 Fundamental Molecular Constraints The necessity for a third body in ozone formation illustrates an important principle in reaction dynamics: highly exothermic reactions involving simple molecules (with few internal degrees of freedom) often cannot effectively distribute the released energy internally. The product molecule becomes vibrationally excited in specific modes that can break newly formed bonds. Third-body collisions provide a mechanism to remove this excess energy, allowing the product to stabilize. This principle applies broadly to association reactions between atoms and small molecules, explaining the prevalence of third-order kinetics in many atmospheric and combustion processes.

While industrial catalysis often employs elevated temperatures, extreme pH values, or high pressures, enzymes achieve remarkable catalytic efficiency at physiological conditions. This specificity and efficiency make enzyme kinetics a particularly fascinating branch of chemical kinetics. Enzymes are biological catalysts—predominantly proteins—that dramatically increase reaction rates by lowering activation energies. Their highly specific three-dimensional structures create active sites where substrate molecules bind and undergo transformation into products. This substrate specificity gives enzymes their remarkable selectivity, often catalysing just one specific reaction among many possibilities. The basic model of enzyme catalysis follows a sequential process: \\[\\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{S} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{ES} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{P}\\] Where: E represents the enzyme S represents the substrate (reactant molecule) ES represents the enzyme-substrate complex P represents the product This simple scheme, first proposed by Victor Henri and later refined by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten, provides the foundation for understanding enzyme kinetics. In this model, the enzyme first binds reversibly to its substrate, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This complex then undergoes a transformation, releasing the product and regenerating the free enzyme. 8.2 The Kinetics of Enzyme-Substrate Binding To develop a quantitative understanding of enzyme kinetics, we must analyse the reaction mechanism step by step. The overall process can be represented more precisely with rate constants: \\[\\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{S} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{ES} \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{P}\\] Here: \\(k_1\\) represents the rate constant for enzyme-substrate association \\(k_{-1}\\) represents the rate constant for enzyme-substrate dissociation \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\) (often called the catalytic constant or turnover number) represents the rate constant for the conversion of the enzyme-substrate complex to products This mechanism leads to the following rate equations: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{ES}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{ES}] - k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{ES}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{ES}]\\] The rate of product formation—which we typically measure experimentally—depends directly on the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex. However, [ES] is difficult to measure directly during a reaction. To develop a useful rate equation, we need to express [ES] in terms of experimentally accessible quantities. 8.3 The Steady State Approximation for Enzyme Kinetics As we’ve seen in previous chapters, the steady state approximation offers a powerful tool for analysing reaction mechanisms involving reactive intermediates. This approach is particularly useful for enzyme kinetics, where the enzyme-substrate complex often reaches a steady-state concentration early in the reaction. To apply the steady state approximation to the ES complex, we set: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{ES}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] This gives: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{ES}] - k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{ES}] = 0\\] Rearranging to solve for [ES]: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}] = [\\mathrm{ES}](k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})\\] \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\\] This equation expresses [ES] in terms of [E] and [S], but we still face a challenge: [E] represents the concentration of free enzyme, which changes during the reaction and is difficult to measure directly. Instead, what we typically know is the total enzyme concentration \\([\\mathrm{E}]_0\\), which remains constant throughout the reaction. The relationship between total enzyme, free enzyme, and enzyme-substrate complex is: \\[[\\mathrm{E}]_0 = [\\mathrm{E}] + [\\mathrm{ES}]\\] Rearranging to express [E] in terms of \\([\\mathrm{E}]_0\\): \\[[\\mathrm{E}] = [\\mathrm{E}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ES}]\\] Substituting this into our expression for [ES]: \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{k_1([\\mathrm{E}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ES}])[\\mathrm{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\\] Multiplying both sides by \\((k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})\\): \\[[\\mathrm{ES}](k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) = k_1([\\mathrm{E}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ES}])[\\mathrm{S}]\\] Expanding the right side: \\[[\\mathrm{ES}](k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) = k_1[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}] - k_1[\\mathrm{ES}][\\mathrm{S}]\\] Rearranging to isolate [ES]: \\[[\\mathrm{ES}](k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1[\\mathrm{S}]) = k_1[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]\\] \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1[\\mathrm{S}]}\\] To simplify this expression further, we can divide both numerator and denominator by \\(k_1\\): \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] 8.4 The Michaelis-Menten Equation At this point, we the Michaelis constant \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\), defined as: \\[K_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}\\] The Michaelis constant combines the rate constants for the various steps in the enzyme mechanism. It has units of concentration (mol dm\\(^{-3}\\)) and quantifies the affinity between enzyme and substrate. A low \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) value indicates high affinity (strong binding), while a high \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) indicates low affinity (weak binding). Using this definition, we can rewrite our expression for [ES]: \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] Now, the rate of product formation becomes: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{ES}] = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\frac{[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] We can further simplify by defining the “maximum velocity” \\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) as the rate when all enzyme molecules are bound to substrate: \\[v_{\\mathrm{max}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{E}]_0\\] This gives us the famous Michaelis-Menten equation: \\[v = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] This equation expresses the initial reaction velocity as a function of substrate concentration, with two key parameters: \\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) and \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\). The equation encapsulates the characteristic behaviour of many enzyme-catalysed reactions: At low substrate concentrations (\\([\\mathrm{S}] \\ll K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\)), the rate is approximately first-order in [S]: \\[v \\approx \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}[\\mathrm{S}]\\] At high substrate concentrations (\\([\\mathrm{S}] \\gg K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\)), the enzyme becomes saturated, and the rate approaches a maximum value (\\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\)): \\[v \\approx v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\] 8.5 Determining Michaelis-Menten Parameters To characterise an enzyme’s kinetic behaviour, we need to determine the parameters \\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) and \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) from experimental data. Several approaches are available: 8.5.1 Non-linear Regression The most accurate approach uses computational methods to fit the Michaelis-Menten equation directly to experimental data. Non-linear least-squares fitting algorithms determine the parameter values that minimise the difference between the model predictions and the observed reaction rates across a range of substrate concentrations. 8.5.2 Graphical Determination of \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) A simple graphical method takes advantage of the fact that when \\(v = v_{\\mathrm{max}}/2\\), the substrate concentration equals \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\). We can demonstrate this by substituting \\(v = v_{\\mathrm{max}}/2\\) into the Michaelis-Menten equation: \\[\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}{2} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] Multiplying both sides by \\((K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}])\\): \\[\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}{2}(K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]) = v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]\\] Expanding the left side: \\[\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{2} + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{2} = v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]\\] Subtracting \\(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{2}\\) from both sides: \\[\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{2} = v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}] - \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{2} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{2}\\] Dividing both sides by \\(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}{2}\\): \\[K_{\\mathrm{M}} = [\\mathrm{S}]\\] This confirms that when the reaction rate equals half the maximum rate, the substrate concentration equals \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\). This property allows us to estimate \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) from a plot of reaction rate versus substrate concentration. 8.5.3 Lineweaver-Burk Plot A third approach transforms the Michaelis-Menten equation into a linear form. Taking the reciprocal of both sides of the Michaelis-Menten equation: \\[\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [\\mathrm{S}]}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{S}]}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{S}]} + \\frac{1}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\] This transformation produces a linear relationship between \\(1/v\\) and \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\): \\[\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{S}]} + \\frac{1}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\] This is the equation of a straight line with: Slope = \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}/v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) y-intercept = \\(1/v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) x-intercept = \\(-1/K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) By plotting experimental data as \\(1/v\\) versus \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\) (known as a Lineweaver-Burk or double-reciprocal plot), we can determine \\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) and \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) from the intercepts. While the Lineweaver-Burk plot provides a straightforward method for estimating Michaelis-Menten parameters, it has limitations. The transformation magnifies errors in measurements at low substrate concentrations. Consequently, modern practice favours direct non-linear regression of the untransformed Michaelis-Menten equation when computational tools are available. 8.6 Quantifying Enzyme Catalytic Efficiency The parameters \\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) and \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) provide valuable insights into enzyme behaviour, but they don’t fully capture an enzyme’s catalytic efficiency. A more comprehensive measure comes from examining the relationship between these parameters. The catalytic constant \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\) (also called the turnover number) represents the maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time: \\[k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}{[\\mathrm{E}]_0}\\] This parameter quantifies how quickly an enzyme can catalyse a reaction once the substrate is bound. High values of \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\) indicate that the enzyme rapidly converts bound substrate to product. However, the catalytic constant alone doesn’t account for how efficiently an enzyme binds its substrate. For a complete picture of catalytic efficiency, we need to consider both binding and catalysis. The specificity constant (or kinetic efficiency) combines these aspects: \\[\\varepsilon = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\] The ratio \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) represents the rate constant for the reaction of enzyme with substrate under conditions where the substrate concentration is much lower than \\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\). It provides a measure of how efficiently an enzyme converts substrate to product at low substrate concentrations. We can understand the physical significance of this ratio by examining the initial rate equation at low substrate concentrations: When \\([\\mathrm{S}] \\ll K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\), the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies to: \\[v \\approx \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]\\] The term \\(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\) appears as a second-order rate constant, describing how rapidly enzyme and substrate molecules come together and form product. We can gain further insight by examining the physical meaning of \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) in terms of the individual rate constants in the enzyme mechanism: \\[\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{(k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})/k_1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\cdot k_1}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\\] This ratio relates the processes that convert substrate to product (\\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\) and \\(k_1\\)) to the processes that convert the enzyme-substrate complex back to free enzyme (\\(k_{-1}\\) and \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\)). The highest possible value of \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\) occurs when every enzyme-substrate encounter leads to product formation—a situation limited only by the rate of diffusion-controlled collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules (approximately 108–109 M−1 s−1). Many of the most efficient enzymes, such as catalase and carbonic anhydrase, approach this diffusion-controlled limit, making them among the most catalytically perfect enzymes known. 8.7 Summary of Enzyme Kinetic Parameters The Michaelis-Menten framework provides several key parameters for characterising enzyme kinetics: Michaelis constant (\\(K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\)): A measure of the affinity between enzyme and substrate. Lower values indicate stronger binding. Maximum velocity (\\(v_{\\mathrm{max}}\\)): The maximum rate of the reaction, achieved when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. Catalytic constant (\\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\)): The turnover number, representing the maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time. Specificity constant (\\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\)): A measure of the overall catalytic efficiency, combining aspects of binding affinity and catalytic rate. These parameters provide a quantitative framework for comparing enzymes, investigating reaction mechanisms, and understanding how enzyme function responds to changing conditions or modifications.

Among these, chain reactions represent a particularly important class characterized by self-propagating sequences of steps. These reactions play crucial roles in diverse processes ranging from polymer synthesis to combustion phenomena and even nuclear fission. Chain reactions involve sequential steps where reactive intermediates, generated in one step, participate in subsequent steps to create new reactive intermediates. This self-perpetuating sequence can lead to distinctive kinetic behavior and, under certain conditions, explosive reactions. 9.2 The H\\(_2\\) + Br\\(_2\\) → 2HBr Chain Reaction A classic example of a chain reaction is the formation of hydrogen bromide from hydrogen and bromine gases: \\[\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\] This seemingly simple reaction follows a complex mechanism involving reactive intermediates. The experimentally determined rate law does not reflect the overall stoichiometric equation: \\[\\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1/2}}{1+k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}\\] This unusual rate expression hints at the underlying complexity of the reaction mechanism. # Insert schematic of chain reaction cycle The actual mechanism consists of several elementary steps: Initiation: \\[\\mathrm{Br}_2 + \\mathrm{M} \\stackrel{k_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Propagation: \\[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightleftharpoons} \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\] \\[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\stackrel{k_3}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\] Termination: \\[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{M} \\stackrel{k_4}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{Br}_2 + \\mathrm{M}\\] In these equations, M represents a third body (often another gas molecule) that absorbs excess energy during collision, and the bullet symbol (\\(\\bullet\\)) indicates a radical species with an unpaired electron. This mechanism includes two key reactive intermediates—bromine atoms (Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\)) and hydrogen atoms (H\\(^{\\bullet}\\))—that sustain the chain reaction. Once formed in the initiation step, these radicals participate in propagation steps that generate product (HBr) while regenerating a reactive intermediate to continue the chain. 9.3 Steady State Analysis of the Chain Reaction To analyse the kinetics of this complex mechanism, we apply the steady state approximation to both reactive intermediates, Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\) and H\\(^{\\bullet}\\). This approach assumes that after an initial transient period, the concentrations of these highly reactive species remain approximately constant as their rates of formation and consumption balance. First, let’s consider the rate equation for H\\(^{\\bullet}\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_2[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{H}_2] - k_{-2}[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{HBr}] - k_3[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{Br}_2] = 0\\] Rearranging to solve for [H\\(^{\\bullet}\\)]: \\[[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}] = \\frac{k_2[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{H}_2]}{k_{-2}[\\mathrm{HBr}] + k_3[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}\\] Next, for Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2k_1[\\mathrm{Br}_2][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{H}_2] + k_{-2}[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{HBr}] + k_3[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{Br}_2] - 2k_4[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]^2[\\mathrm{M}] = 0\\] When we substitute our expression for [H\\(^{\\bullet}\\)], the equation becomes quite complex. However, if we recognize that the propagation steps maintain the balance of Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\) (Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\) is consumed in one step and regenerated in the next), we can simplify: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2k_1[\\mathrm{Br}_2][\\mathrm{M}] - 2k_4[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]^2[\\mathrm{M}] = 0\\] This simplification assumes that the propagation steps are much faster than the initiation and termination steps, which is typically true for chain reactions. From this simplified equation, we can solve for [Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\)]: \\[2k_1[\\mathrm{Br}_2][\\mathrm{M}] = 2k_4[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]^2[\\mathrm{M}]\\] \\[[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}] = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}{k_4}}\\] # Insert figure showing steady state concentration of Br• Now we can determine the overall rate of HBr formation. The rate equation is: \\[\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{HBr}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{H}_2] - k_{-2}[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{HBr}] + k_3[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}][\\mathrm{Br}_2]\\] Substituting our expressions for [Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\)] and [H\\(^{\\bullet}\\)] and performing algebraic manipulations (the detailed steps are quite involved), we eventually arrive at: \\[\\nu = \\frac{2k_2\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{k_4}}[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1/2}}{1 + \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_3}\\frac{[\\mathrm{HBr}]}{[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}}\\] This derived rate law matches the experimentally observed form, with \\(k = 2k_2\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{k_4}}\\) and \\(k&#39; = \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_3}\\). The presence of HBr in the denominator represents an inhibitory effect—the reverse reaction \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\) competes with the forward propagation step, reducing the overall reaction rate. This step is called an inhibition step. 9.4 Chain Reaction Types and Characteristics Chain reactions exhibit several distinctive characteristics: A cyclic propagation sequence where reactive intermediates continually regenerate Initiation steps that create the initial reactive intermediates Termination steps that remove reactive intermediates from the cycle Possible inhibition steps that can compete with propagation # Insert diagram of chain reaction steps Chain reactions can be further classified based on how the reactive intermediates evolve during the propagation sequence: 9.4.1 Straight Chain Reactions In a straight chain reaction, each propagation step regenerates exactly one reactive intermediate. The HBr formation reaction is an example—each time Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\) is consumed, exactly one H\\(^{\\bullet}\\) is generated, and when H\\(^{\\bullet}\\) is consumed, exactly one Br\\(^{\\bullet}\\) is regenerated. 9.4.2 Branching Chain Reactions In a branching chain reaction, one or more propagation steps create multiple reactive intermediates from a single one. The classic example is the combustion of hydrogen: \\[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{O}^{\\bullet}\\] \\[\\mathrm{O}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\] \\[\\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\] In the first step, one radical (H\\(^{\\bullet}\\)) generates two radicals (OH\\(^{\\bullet}\\) and O\\(^{\\bullet}\\)), causing the reaction to accelerate as the chain branches. Branching chain reactions can lead to explosive behavior if the rate of intermediate generation exceeds the rate of termination. 9.5 Feedback Mechanisms in Chain Reactions Chain reactions often exhibit complex kinetic behavior due to feedback mechanisms between the reactants, products, and reactive intermediates. These feedback mechanisms can be either negative (self-regulating) or positive (self-accelerating). 9.5.1 Negative Feedback and Steady State Behavior In a reaction with negative feedback, the concentration of reactive intermediates naturally stabilizes due to self-regulating processes. This behavior underlies the steady state approximation that we applied earlier. Consider a simple model where an intermediate I forms at rate \\(\\nu_f\\) and is consumed at a rate proportional to its concentration: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\nu_f - k[\\mathrm{I}]\\] This differential equation has the solution: \\[[\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{k}(1 - e^{-kt})\\] # Insert plot showing approach to steady state As \\(t\\) increases, \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\) approaches a steady-state value \\(\\nu_f/k\\). This represents a balance between formation and consumption processes. The higher the concentration of I becomes, the faster it is consumed, providing a natural stabilizing mechanism. 9.5.2 Feedback Behavior and System Stability Chain reactions can exhibit either stable or explosive behavior depending on the balance between intermediate production and consumption. This balance is captured in a general rate equation for the reactive intermediate I: \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{\\mathrm{init}}[\\mathrm{M}] + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]\\) where \\(\\phi = k_{\\mathrm{prop}}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{\\mathrm{term}}\\) represents the balance between propagation and termination processes. The constant term \\(k_{\\mathrm{init}}[\\mathrm{M}]\\) (which we can denote as \\(\\nu_f\\) for simplicity) represents the rate of initiation—the formation of new intermediates independent of existing intermediates. The parameter \\(\\phi\\) crucially determines the system’s behavior: If \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\) (termination dominates), the system exhibits negative feedback and reaches a steady state. If \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\) (propagation dominates), the system exhibits positive feedback and undergoes exponential growth, potentially leading to explosive behavior. # Insert comparative plot of negative and positive feedback The general solution to this differential equation is: \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{\\phi}(e^{\\phi t} - 1)\\) This single equation describes both stabilizing and explosive behaviors: When \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\) (negative feedback), \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\) approaches a steady-state value of \\(\\frac{\\nu_f}{|\\phi|}\\) as \\(t\\) increases. When \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\) (positive feedback), \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\) grows exponentially as \\(t\\) increases, continuing until limited by reactant depletion or other physical constraints. 9.6 Mathematical Analysis of Feedback Systems Let’s rigorously derive the time-dependent concentration profile for our general feedback system. The governing differential equation is: \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]\\) This single equation describes both negative and positive feedback systems, with the sign of \\(\\phi\\) determining which behavior emerges. To solve this equation, we begin by separating variables: \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]} = \\mathrm{d}t\\) Integrating both sides from the initial concentration \\([\\mathrm{I}]_0\\) (typically zero) to \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\): \\(\\int_{[\\mathrm{I}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{I}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]} = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}t\\) The left-hand integral can be solved by substitution with \\(u = \\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]\\), which gives \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\phi}\\): \\(\\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]} = \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\int\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{u} = \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\ln(u) + C\\) Applying the limits of integration: \\(\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t}{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_0}\\right) = t\\) With \\([\\mathrm{I}]_0 = 0\\), this simplifies to: \\(\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t}{\\nu_f}\\right) = t\\) Rearranging to solve for \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\): \\(\\frac{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t}{\\nu_f} = e^{\\phi t}\\) \\(\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\nu_f e^{\\phi t}\\) \\(\\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\nu_f(e^{\\phi t} - 1)\\) \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{\\phi}(e^{\\phi t} - 1)\\) This solution applies universally to our feedback system, with the behavior determined by the sign of \\(\\phi\\): # Insert figure showing solution profiles for different φ values For negative feedback (\\(\\phi &lt; 0\\)): As \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(e^{\\phi t} \\rightarrow 0\\), so \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t \\rightarrow \\frac{\\nu_f}{|\\phi|}\\) The system reaches a steady state concentration where formation and consumption rates balance. For positive feedback (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)): As \\(t\\) increases, \\(e^{\\phi t}\\) grows exponentially, so \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t\\) also grows exponentially This growth continues until physical limitations (such as reactant depletion) intervene. This mathematical analysis demonstrates how a single differential equation can generate qualitatively different behaviors depending on the parameter values, a hallmark of many complex chemical systems. 9.7 Practical Implications of Chain Reactions Chain reactions have numerous practical implications in both natural systems and industrial processes: Combustion and Explosion Control: Understanding chain reaction mechanisms is crucial for preventing industrial accidents and designing safe combustion systems. Polymer Synthesis: Many polymerization reactions proceed via chain mechanisms, where control of initiation and termination determines the polymer’s molecular weight distribution. Free Radical Chemistry: Biological free radical processes, including oxidative stress mechanisms, often involve chain reactions that must be controlled by antioxidants to prevent cellular damage. Atmospheric Chemistry: Chain reactions involving free radicals drive many important processes in atmospheric chemistry, including ozone depletion and smog formation. The balance between propagation, branching, and termination steps determines whether a chain reaction proceeds steadily or explosively—a fundamental consideration in both industrial safety and chemical process design. # Insert figure showing applications of chain reactions 9.8 Summary Chain reactions represent a distinctive class of chemical processes characterized by self-propagating sequences of elementary steps involving reactive intermediates. The application of steady state approximations allows us to derive complex rate laws that emerge from these multi-step mechanisms. The feedback behavior in chain reactions—whether negative or positive—determines their stability characteristics: Negative feedback leads to self-regulating, steady-state behavior Positive feedback can lead to exponential growth and potentially explosive reactions Mathematical analysis of these systems reveals how the competition between initiation, propagation, and termination processes controls the overall reaction dynamics. These principles provide essential insights for understanding complex reaction systems ranging from atmospheric chemistry to industrial processes.

Food preservation through refrigeration, the acceleration of cooking at higher temperatures, and the use of heat to speed up laboratory reactions all demonstrate the significant influence of temperature on chemical kinetics. These observations reflect a fundamental principle: most chemical reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases. In previous chapters, we examined how reaction rates depend on reactant concentrations, establishing methods for determining rate laws and exploring the relationship between mechanisms and observed kinetics. This chapter addresses the second major factor affecting reaction rates: temperature. Understanding the temperature dependence of reaction rates is essential for predicting reaction behavior under various conditions and provides insight into the energetic requirements of chemical transformations. 10.2 The Arrhenius Equation In the late 19th century, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius observed that for many reactions, the rate constant varies with temperature according to a simple mathematical relationship. This relationship, now known as the Arrhenius equation, expresses the rate constant as: \\[k = A \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT} \\right)\\] where: - \\(k\\) is the rate constant - \\(A\\) is the pre-exponential factor (with the same units as \\(k\\)) - \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is the activation energy (typically in kJ mol\\(^{-1}\\)) - \\(R\\) is the gas constant (8.314 J K\\(^{-1}\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\)) - \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) The Arrhenius equation has proven remarkably effective in describing the temperature dependence of rate constants across diverse chemical systems. It establishes that rate constants increase exponentially with temperature, which explains the substantial acceleration of reactions observed when temperature is raised. 10.3 Linearised Form of the Arrhenius Equation For experimental analysis, the Arrhenius equation is often recast in logarithmic form. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields: \\[\\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\] This transformation produces a linear relationship between \\(\\ln k\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\), with: Slope = \\(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R}\\) y-intercept = \\(\\ln A\\) This linear form facilitates the experimental determination of Arrhenius parameters from rate constant measurements at different temperatures. 10.4 General Expression for Activation Energy The activation energy can be defined more generally through the temperature dependence of the rate constant: \\[E_\\mathrm{a}(T) = -R \\frac{d \\ln k}{d(1/T)}\\] For reactions that strictly follow the Arrhenius equation, \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is independent of temperature. However, many real systems show some temperature variation in \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\), requiring more complex models. 10.5 Alternative Forms of the Arrhenius Equation The Arrhenius equation can also be expressed in terms of the Boltzmann distribution factor: \\[k = A e^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT}\\] This formulation emphasizes that the rate constant comprises two distinct components: the pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) and the exponential term that contains both temperature and activation energy. 10.6 Physical Meaning of Arrhenius Parameters The Arrhenius equation incorporates two parameters that characterize how a reaction responds to temperature changes. While these parameters were initially derived empirically, they possess physical interpretations that enhance our understanding of reaction kinetics. 10.6.1 The Activation Energy (\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\)) The activation energy represents an energy threshold that must be exceeded for a chemical reaction to occur. This concept provides insight into the temperature dependence of reaction rates: \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) corresponds approximately to the minimum energy required for reactants to transform into products At higher temperatures, a larger fraction of molecules possess sufficient energy to surpass this threshold The exponential term in the Arrhenius equation (\\(e^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT}\\)) quantifies the proportion of molecules with energy exceeding the required minimum 10.6.2 The Pre-exponential Factor (\\(A\\)) The pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) represents the theoretical maximum rate constant—the value that would be observed if either the activation energy barrier were absent (\\(E_\\mathrm{a} = 0\\)) or the temperature were infinite. From a physical perspective, \\(A\\) encompasses several factors: - The frequency of molecular collisions - Geometric requirements for successful reaction (such as molecular orientation) - Other factors that influence reaction probability independent of energy considerations The pre-exponential factor has the same units as the rate constant \\(k\\) and is specific to each reaction. 10.7 Reaction Energy Profiles A valuable conceptual tool for understanding activation energy is the reaction energy profile, also known as a reaction coordinate diagram: This diagram illustrates the energy changes that occur as reactants transform into products. The activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) corresponds to the height of the energy barrier that separates reactants from products. This representation provides an intuitive framework for understanding why energy input (often in the form of heat) facilitates chemical reactions. More sophisticated treatments of reaction kinetics will provide additional refinements to this conceptual model, but the essential framework remains valid—reactions require energy to overcome a barrier, and the Arrhenius equation quantifies how temperature affects this process. 10.8 Determining Arrhenius Parameters from Experimental Data Several methodologies exist for extracting Arrhenius parameters from experimental measurements of rate constants at different temperatures. 10.8.1 Linear Regression Analysis The most common approach involves measuring rate constants at multiple temperatures and plotting \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\). Linear regression analysis of this plot provides: Slope = \\(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R}\\), from which \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is calculated y-intercept = \\(\\ln A\\), from which \\(A\\) is determined While conceptually straightforward, this approach has certain limitations. The logarithmic transformation can distort experimental errors, particularly at extreme temperatures. Additionally, extrapolation to determine the y-intercept (\\(\\frac{1}{T} = 0\\), corresponding to infinite temperature) introduces substantial uncertainties in the estimation of \\(A\\). 10.8.2 Non-linear Regression Contemporary computational methods permit direct non-linear fitting of the Arrhenius equation in its original exponential form: \\[k = A \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT} \\right)\\] This approach avoids the error distortion that occurs with logarithmic transformation and typically yields more reliable parameter estimates, especially when data span a limited temperature range. 10.8.3 Two-Point Estimation When data are available at only two temperatures, the activation energy can still be estimated. For temperatures \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) with corresponding rate constants \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\): \\[\\ln k_1 = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT_1}\\] \\[\\ln k_2 = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT_2}\\] Subtracting the first equation from the second eliminates \\(\\ln A\\): \\[\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1 = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\right)\\] Rearranging to solve for \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\): \\[E_\\mathrm{a} = \\frac{R \\ln(k_2/k_1)}{\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}}\\] This approach provides a first approximation but cannot account for deviations from Arrhenius behavior across broader temperature ranges. 10.8.4 Estimating \\(A\\) from Graphical Data When working with Arrhenius plots (\\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\)), the pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) corresponds to the y-intercept (\\(\\ln A\\)). Direct extrapolation to \\(\\frac{1}{T} = 0\\) introduces large uncertainties because this point lies far from the experimental data range. A more reliable method uses the slope and a point on the fitted line: Determine the slope \\(m = -\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R}\\) from the linear fit Select a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) on the line, preferably within the data range Calculate the intercept \\(c = y_0 - mx_0\\) Compute the pre-exponential factor as \\(A = e^c\\) This method circumvents the uncertainties associated with extreme extrapolation while providing a reliable estimate of \\(A\\). 10.9 Special Cases and Deviations from Arrhenius Behavior While the Arrhenius equation successfully describes many reactions, several important cases exhibit more complex temperature dependence. 10.9.1 Negative Activation Energies For most reactions, the activation energy is positive, and rates increase with temperature. However, certain reactions display the opposite behavior—their rates decrease as temperature rises, corresponding to a negative activation energy. This counterintuitive behavior typically indicates a complex reaction mechanism rather than a true “downhill” elementary process. For example, the oxidation of nitric oxide: \\[2\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO}_2\\] exhibits a negative temperature dependence with empirical rate law: \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{NO}_2]}{dt} = k[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O}_2]\\] Such behavior typically arises in multi-step reaction mechanisms. In the case of NO oxidation, a reversible first step becomes less favorable at higher temperatures, leading to the observed decrease in overall reaction rate. 10.9.2 Non-Arrhenius Behavior Several situations can lead to deviations from simple Arrhenius behavior: Multiple reaction pathways: When parallel reaction paths with different activation energies contribute to the overall process, the apparent activation energy may vary with temperature. This occurs because the relative contribution of each pathway changes with temperature—lower-\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) paths dominate at lower temperatures, while higher-\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) paths become increasingly important at higher temperatures. Change in rate-determining step: For reactions with sequential steps in a mechanism, changes in temperature can shift which step limits the overall rate. This phenomenon occurs because steps with different activation energies respond differently to temperature changes, potentially altering which step is rate-determining as temperature varies. Diffusion-limited reactions: When reaction rates approach the limit set by diffusion processes, the temperature dependence weakens. This occurs because diffusion typically has a lower activation energy than chemical transformation steps. Quantum tunneling effects: At very low temperatures, quantum tunneling can allow reactions to proceed despite insufficient thermal energy to overcome the classical barrier, causing deviations from Arrhenius behavior. 10.10 Predicting Rate Constants at Different Temperatures A practical application of the Arrhenius equation involves predicting rate constants at temperatures where direct measurements may be impractical. If the activation energy and rate constant are known at one temperature, the rate constant at another temperature can be estimated. Starting with the Arrhenius equation in logarithmic form: \\[\\ln k_1 = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT_1}\\] \\[\\ln k_2 = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT_2}\\] Subtracting the first equation from the second: \\[\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1 = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\right)\\] Rearranging: \\[\\ln \\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\right)\\] This equation enables estimation of how rate constants change between two temperatures without requiring knowledge of the pre-exponential factor \\(A\\). This approach assumes that \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) remains constant across the temperature range of interest—a reasonable approximation for many reactions within moderate temperature intervals. For reactions with positive activation energies, rate constants increase with temperature. A general guideline derived from typical activation energy values suggests that many reaction rates approximately double with every 10°C increase in temperature, though the exact factor depends on the specific activation energy of the reaction in question. 10.11 Summary The Arrhenius equation provides a fundamental framework for understanding and quantifying how temperature affects reaction rates. The exponential relationship between temperature and rate constants explains the significant acceleration of most chemical reactions at elevated temperatures. The two Arrhenius parameters—the pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) and the activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\)—relate empirical kinetic behavior to a conceptual model of reactions requiring an energy threshold to proceed. The activation energy represents the energy barrier that reactant molecules must overcome, while the pre-exponential factor encompasses various factors affecting reaction probability independent of energy considerations. Experimental determination of these parameters through regression analysis allows for characterization of reactions and prediction of their behavior across different temperature ranges. The Arrhenius equation thus serves as a powerful tool linking macroscopic kinetic measurements to fundamental aspects of chemical reactivity. While the Arrhenius equation applies to a wide range of chemical processes, cases such as negative activation energies and non-Arrhenius behavior reveal the complexity of reaction mechanisms. These exceptions provide valuable insights into the intricate nature of chemical transformations and the limitations of simple kinetic models.

For any species X involved in a reaction, its rate of concentration change is related to the overall reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) by: \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of X (positive for products, negative for reactants). This elegant relationship unifies the rates of change of all species in a reaction—but where does it come from? The answer lies in a fundamental principle of chemistry: the conservation of mass. When we examine how reaction concentrations evolve over time, mass balance relationships provide the key to understanding how different species’ rates of change are connected. This appendix explores how mass conservation leads naturally to these rate relationships. A.1 The Origins of Mass Balance Consider a simple reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] While concentrations of A and B change over time, the total mass of the system remains constant - this is the principle of conservation of mass. For this simple reaction, at any time \\(t\\): \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] where \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) are the initial concentrations at \\(t=0\\). # Plot showing [A] and [B] vs time with horizontal line showing constant total In cases where \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\) (starting with pure reactant), this simplifies to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A.2 From Mass Balance to Rate Relationships The mass balance equation provides a constraint that links the rates of change of A and B. Taking the derivative with respect to time: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}([\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Since \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) is constant, its derivative is zero: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This tells us that for this simple reaction, the rate of formation of B equals the rate of consumption of A. A.3 Mass Balance with Stoichiometry Now consider a reaction where one molecule of A produces two molecules of B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{B}\\] # Diagram showing A → 2B transformation The mass balance equation becomes: \\[2[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = 2[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] The factor of 2 for [A] accounts for the fact that each A molecule contains the mass equivalent of two B molecules. Taking the derivative: \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This shows that B is produced twice as fast as A is consumed, consistent with the stoichiometry. A.4 Generalizing to Complex Reactions For a general reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C} + 3\\mathrm{D}\\] The reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) can be expressed in terms of any species’ concentration change: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This leads to the general form: \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species X (negative for reactants, positive for products). A.5 Equilibrium Reactions and Mass Balance For an equilibrium reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} 2\\mathrm{B}\\] # Diagram showing equilibrium with labeled rate constants The rate of change of [A] has contributions from both forward and reverse reactions: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]^2\\] The first term represents unimolecular decomposition of A, while the second term represents the bimolecular recombination of B. Similarly for B: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +2k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - 2k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]^2\\] These equations satisfy mass balance: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] A.6 Key Principles Total mass is conserved in chemical reactions Mass balance provides constraints on concentration changes Stoichiometric coefficients determine the relative rates of concentration changes Mass balance applies to both irreversible and equilibrium reactions # Diagram illustrating key concepts "],["why-arent-all-bimolecular-reactions-third-order.html", "B Why Aren’t All Bimolecular Reactions Third Order? B.1 An Apparent Contradiction in Reaction Kinetics B.2 The Ozone Formation Challenge B.3 Why Most Bimolecular Reactions Don’t Require a Third Body B.4 A Spectrum of Behavior B.5 Conclusions", " B Why Aren’t All Bimolecular Reactions Third Order? B.1 An Apparent Contradiction in Reaction Kinetics The formation of ozone follows an unusual kinetic pattern: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Despite appearing to be a simple combination of an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule, this reaction exhibits third-order kinetics, requiring the involvement of a third body (M). This raises an important question: if the reaction between O and O2 cannot proceed without a third body, why do we observe countless other bimolecular gas-phase reactions that follow simple second-order kinetics? The laws of physics—conservation of energy and momentum—apply universally to all molecular collisions. If these constraints prevent a simple O + O2 reaction, they should theoretically create similar challenges for other bimolecular reactions. Understanding why this isn’t the case requires examining the molecular-level details of different reaction types. B.2 The Ozone Formation Challenge When an oxygen atom collides with an oxygen molecule, forming a new O-O bond releases approximately 107 kJ/mol of energy. This substantial energy must be accommodated within the newly formed O3 molecule. Conservation of momentum constrains this process. In a head-on collision, momentum conservation dictates that the resulting O3 molecule carries the combined momentum of both reactants. This constraint directs much of the released energy into vibrational modes of the O3 molecule rather than allowing it to dissipate as translational energy. With only three atoms, ozone has just three vibrational modes available to absorb this energy. Consequently, the newly formed bond becomes so vibrationally excited that it exceeds its own dissociation energy—the molecule would break apart again without some mechanism to remove this excess energy. The third body (M) provides the necessary solution. When it collides with the vibrationally excited O3*, it can carry away excess energy as translational motion, allowing the ozone molecule to stabilize. B.3 Why Most Bimolecular Reactions Don’t Require a Third Body Given that momentum and energy conservation apply universally, one might expect all bimolecular reactions to require third bodies. This would mean we should never observe simple second-order kinetics for any gas-phase bimolecular reaction. Yet such reactions are common. Several key factors allow most bimolecular reactions to proceed without third-body intervention: B.3.1 Activation Barriers: Redirecting Energy Flow Most chemical reactions feature an activation energy barrier, creating a transition state that must be traversed before products form. This feature plays a crucial role in energy redistribution. On a potential energy surface, a reaction with a barrier features a saddle point—a mountain pass through which the reaction must proceed. As the system descends from this saddle point toward products, the topography of the energy landscape guides energy into multiple modes of motion. This descent from a barrier redistributes energy among various degrees of freedom—vibrational, rotational, and translational—preventing excessive concentration in any single vibration. This redistribution often keeps the energy in any single bond below the dissociation threshold. Ozone formation, being barrierless, lacks this redistribution mechanism. Without a saddle point to navigate, energy remains concentrated along the direct approach coordinate. B.3.2 Molecular Complexity: More Storage Compartments for Energy The capacity of a molecule to absorb energy without dissociating increases with its size and complexity. A non-linear molecule with N atoms has 3N-6 vibrational modes. For ozone (N=3), this means only 3 vibrational modes, offering limited pathways to distribute the reaction energy. Consider, by contrast, a reaction forming a molecule with 10 atoms. With 24 vibrational modes available, energy can distribute much more widely, reducing the amount concentrated in any single bond. This spreading of energy decreases the likelihood that any particular bond will receive enough energy to break. B.3.3 Exchange Reactions: Energy Balancing Acts Many bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous bond breaking and formation: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{BC} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AB} + \\mathrm{C}\\] In these exchange reactions, energy required to break the BC bond partly offsets energy released by forming the AB bond. This balanced energy flow reduces the net energy that products must accommodate, avoiding the problem of excessive vibrational excitation. The formation of ozone, in contrast, involves pure bond formation with no offsetting bond breaking, creating a significant energy management challenge. B.3.4 The Influence of Reaction Barriers on Energy Partitioning The presence of an activation barrier does more than simply redirect energy—it changes how energy partitions between different molecular motions in the products. In barrierless reactions like ozone formation, momentum conservation in the direct approach directs energy predominantly into vibration along the bond-forming coordinate. The system lacks any mechanism to redirect this energy flow. For reactions with barriers, the descent from the transition state involves a trajectory along multiple coordinates. The saddle point geometry creates couplings between different molecular motions, directing energy into rotational and translational modes rather than concentrating it in vibration. This energy partitioning explains why many exothermic reactions with barriers can proceed without third-body stabilization despite releasing considerable energy. B.4 A Spectrum of Behavior Rather than a strict division between reactions that do or don’t require third bodies, chemical reactions exhibit a spectrum of behaviors. The likelihood of requiring third-body stabilization increases with: Decreasing activation barrier height Increasing reaction exothermicity Decreasing molecular complexity Pure association rather than exchange character The ozone formation reaction represents an extreme case along this spectrum—a highly exothermic, barrierless association reaction forming a small molecule. These combined factors create conditions requiring third-body intervention. Most bimolecular reactions we typically study feature some combination of activation barriers, moderate energy release, greater molecular complexity, or exchange character that allows them to manage reaction energy without third-body assistance. B.5 Conclusions The observation that some reactions require third bodies while others don’t is explained by examining how energy distributes during molecular collisions. The physical principles of energy and momentum conservation apply universally, but their consequences vary based on reaction energetics, molecular structure, and reaction mechanism. The existence of simple second-order kinetics for many bimolecular reactions doesn’t contradict the principles that make ozone formation require a third body. It reflects the different mechanisms by which chemical systems accommodate and redistribute energy during reactions. These principles help explain the diverse rate behaviors observed across chemical systems—from atmospheric processes to combustion chemistry to biological transformations.

C.2 Physical Origins of Negative Orders C.3 Example 1: Chain Reaction Inhibition in H2 + Br2 → 2HBr C.4 Example 2: Competitive Adsorption in Surface Reactions C.5 Recognising Negative Orders C.6 Practical Implications", " C Negative Reaction Orders C.1 What Are Negative Reaction Orders? In most cases, increasing the concentration of a reactant increases the reaction rate; this corresponds to positive reaction orders. In some reactions, however, increasing the concentration of a particular species slows down the reaction. This unusual behaviour manifests as a negative reaction order. Mathematically, when a species X appears with a negative order \\(n\\) in a rate law: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b[\\mathrm{X}]^{-n}\\] or equivalently: \\[\\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b}{[\\mathrm{X}]^n}\\] increasing \\([\\mathrm{X}]\\) decreases the reaction rate. The species X effectively acts as an inhibitor rather than a promoter of the reaction. C.2 Physical Origins of Negative Orders Negative reaction orders always signal the presence of a complex, multi-step mechanism. They cannot arise from simple, elementary processes but instead emerge from: Competitive inhibition - where a species competes with productive reaction pathways Product inhibition - where reaction products interfere with the forward mechanism Site blocking - in surface reactions and enzyme systems where species compete for limited active sites Reverse reactions - where a species promotes the backward reaction The key insight is that these species participate in the overall mechanism but in ways that hinder rather than help the net forward reaction. C.3 Example 1: Chain Reaction Inhibition in H2 + Br2 → 2HBr The formation of hydrogen bromide demonstrates product inhibition leading to negative orders. The empirical rate law for this reaction is: \\[\\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}]}\\] At high concentrations of HBr, this simplifies to show negative dependence on the product: \\[\\nu \\approx \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{3/2}}{k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]}\\] Here, HBr has an effective order of −1. The very product we are trying to make actually inhibits its own formation! C.3.1 Why Does This Happen? The H2 + Br2 reaction proceeds through a chain mechanism involving reactive radical intermediates. The key steps include: Chain propagation: \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) Chain propagation: \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) Chain inhibition: \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2}\\) The crucial point is the final step: HBr can react with the reactive H\\(^{\\bullet}\\) radicals that drive the chain reaction forward. This consumes the very intermediates needed for product formation. The more HBr present in the system, the more this reverse reaction competes with productive chain propagation, effectively slowing down the net rate of HBr formation. This illustrates a general principle: in chain reactions, anything that consumes or deactivates the chain-carrying intermediates will show negative kinetic behaviour. C.4 Example 2: Competitive Adsorption in Surface Reactions Surface-catalysed reactions provide another important class of systems that show negative orders. Consider a reaction A + B → products occurring on a catalyst surface. Unlike homogeneous reactions, surface processes require that reactants first adsorb onto the catalyst before they can react. The catalyst surface has a limited number of active sites, creating the potential for competition between different species. For a typical surface reaction following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism: \\(\\mathrm{A}_{(\\mathrm{g})} + * \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}*\\) (A adsorbs on empty site *) \\(\\mathrm{B}_{(\\mathrm{g})} + * \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B}*\\) (B adsorbs on empty site *) \\(\\mathrm{A}* + \\mathrm{B}* \\rightarrow \\text{products} + 2*\\) (reaction between adsorbed species) The rate depends on having both A and B adsorbed on adjacent sites. However, if one species (say B) adsorbs much more strongly than the other, or if its gas-phase pressure becomes very high, it can monopolise the surface sites. C.4.1 The Site-Blocking Effect When B saturates the surface, there are fewer sites available for A to adsorb, even though we need both species present for the reaction to occur. Under these conditions, increasing the pressure of B actually decreases the reaction rate because: B blocks sites that A needs The surface coverage of A decreases Fewer A-B pairs can form on adjacent sites The overall reaction rate falls This leads to negative apparent orders in B at high pressures, despite B being an essential reactant. This behaviour is commonly observed in industrial catalysis. For example: In ammonia synthesis, high hydrogen pressures can inhibit the reaction by preventing nitrogen adsorption In CO oxidation, excess CO can poison the catalyst by blocking oxygen adsorption sites In hydrogenation reactions, too much hydrogen can prevent the organic substrate from accessing the catalyst surface C.5 Recognising Negative Orders Negative orders often appear in disguised forms within rate expressions: Denominator terms: Any concentration appearing in the denominator has a negative effective order, whether directly (e.g., \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]/[\\mathrm{X}]\\)) or within inhibition factors (e.g., \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]/(1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{X}])\\)) Inhibition factors: Terms like \\((1 + k[\\mathrm{X}])\\) in the denominator indicate negative effects Saturation behaviour: Rates that plateau or decrease with increasing concentration suggest competitive effects C.6 Practical Implications Understanding negative orders has important practical consequences: Process Optimisation: Simply increasing all reactant concentrations won’t necessarily speed up a reaction. There may be optimal concentration ratios that maximise the rate. Catalyst Design: Recognising competitive adsorption helps in designing catalysts with appropriate site distributions or selectivities. Product Removal: For reactions showing product inhibition, continuously removing products can maintain higher reaction rates. Industrial Control: Many industrial processes must carefully control reactant ratios to avoid operating in negative-order regimes where increasing a reactant concentration actually decreases productivity.
