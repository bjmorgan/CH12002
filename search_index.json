Describing rates of change is exactly what calculus does, so differentiation and integration are central tools throughout this course. We also make heavy use of exponentials and logarithms, both because exponential functions arise naturally from the underlying mathematics and because logarithms let us convert curved data into straight-line plots for analysis. You will have met all of this material in CH12004. This chapter collects the key results and techniques in one place for easy reference. If any of it feels unfamiliar, consult your CH12004 notes or the resources listed at the end of this chapter, and revisit this preface as needed during the course. 0.1 Working with Exponentials and Logarithms Exponential functions and logarithms appear throughout chemical kinetics. This section collects the key identities and techniques you will need. 0.1.1 Exponential Functions The exponential function \\(\\mathrm{e}^x\\) (also written \\(\\exp(x)\\)) has a special mathematical property: it is the only function whose derivative equals itself. This means that whenever a quantity changes at a rate proportional to its current value, the solution involves an exponential—a situation we will encounter repeatedly. The following identities are useful for manipulating exponential expressions: \\[\\mathrm{e}^{a+b} = \\mathrm{e}^a \\mathrm{e}^b\\] \\[\\mathrm{e}^{-a} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}^a}\\] \\[(\\mathrm{e}^a)^n = \\mathrm{e}^{na}\\] \\[\\mathrm{e}^0 = 1\\] 0.1.2 Logarithmic Functions The natural logarithm \\(\\ln x\\) is the inverse of the exponential function: if \\(y = \\mathrm{e}^x\\), then \\(x = \\ln y\\). The following identities are useful for manipulating logarithmic expressions: \\[\\ln(ab) = \\ln a + \\ln b\\] \\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\ln a - \\ln b\\] \\[\\ln(a^n) = n \\ln a\\] \\[\\ln 1 = 0\\] \\[\\ln \\mathrm{e} = 1\\] A particularly useful rearrangement combines two of these: \\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\\] 0.1.3 Converting Between Exponential and Logarithmic Forms The relationship between exponentials and logarithms can be written as: \\[y = \\mathrm{e}^x \\iff x = \\ln y\\] This equivalence is essential when rearranging equations. For example, if we have an equation of the form: \\[y = A \\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\] we can take the natural logarithm of both sides to obtain: \\[\\ln y = \\ln\\left(A \\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\right) = \\ln A + \\ln\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\right) = \\ln A + bx\\] Each step uses one of the logarithm identities listed above. Make sure you can follow—and reproduce—this chain of reasoning. 0.2 Linearising Exponential Equations A common task in experimental science is converting a curved relationship into a straight line suitable for graphical analysis. If we have data that we believe follow an exponential relationship, plotting the raw data gives a curve. By taking logarithms, we can transform this into a straight line, making it easier to test our hypothesis and extract parameters. 0.2.1 General Approach For an equation of the form: \\[y = A\\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\] where \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: \\[\\ln y = \\ln A + bx\\] This has the form of a straight line (\\(y&#39; = c + mx&#39;\\)): \\[\\underbrace{\\ln y}_{y&#39;} = \\underbrace{\\ln A}_{c} + \\underbrace{b}_{m}\\underbrace{x}_{x&#39;}\\] So plotting \\(\\ln y\\) against \\(x\\) gives a straight line with: Slope \\(= b\\) Intercept \\(= \\ln A\\) (and hence \\(A = \\mathrm{e}^{\\text{intercept}}\\)) 0.2.2 Example Suppose we measure a quantity \\(y\\) at several values of \\(x\\) and suspect that \\(y = 5\\mathrm{e}^{-0.3x}\\). Plotting \\(y\\) against \\(x\\) gives a curve, but plotting \\(\\ln y\\) against \\(x\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-0.3\\) and intercept \\(\\ln 5 \\approx 1.61\\). If the data fall on a straight line in this transformed plot, our hypothesis is confirmed, and we can read off the parameters from the slope and intercept. This technique—plotting a transformed variable to produce a straight line—will be one of our most important analytical tools. 0.3 Differentiation The derivative of a function tells us its rate of change. If \\(y\\) depends on \\(x\\), then \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\) tells us how rapidly \\(y\\) changes when \\(x\\) changes by a small amount. Graphically, the derivative at any point equals the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point. In this course, our functions typically describe how concentrations change with time, so the derivative \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) tells us how rapidly the concentration of a species is changing at a given moment. 0.3.1 Key Results The derivatives we use most frequently are: Function \\(f(x)\\) Derivative \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\) \\(x^n\\) \\(nx^{n-1}\\) \\(\\mathrm{e}^{x}\\) \\(\\mathrm{e}^{x}\\) \\(\\mathrm{e}^{ax}\\) \\(a\\mathrm{e}^{ax}\\) \\(\\ln x\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) constant \\(0\\) For a function multiplied by a constant: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(Af(x)\\right) = A\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\] 0.3.2 The Special Property of Exponentials The exponential function is unique in that its derivative is proportional to itself: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(A\\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\right) = Ab\\mathrm{e}^{bx} = b \\times \\left(A\\mathrm{e}^{bx}\\right)\\] This means that whenever the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the quantity itself, the solution is an exponential function. 0.3.3 Example If \\(y = 3\\mathrm{e}^{-2t}\\), then: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 3 \\times (-2) \\times \\mathrm{e}^{-2t} = -6\\mathrm{e}^{-2t}\\] Notice that \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2y\\). The rate of change of \\(y\\) is proportional to \\(y\\) itself. 0.4 Integration Integration is the reverse of differentiation. If differentiation tells us the rate of change of a function, integration lets us reconstruct the function from its rate of change. In this course, we will often know how rapidly a concentration is changing (from a rate equation) and need to work out how the concentration itself evolves over time. 0.4.1 Key Results The integrals we use most frequently are: Function \\(f(x)\\) Integral \\(\\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\) \\(x^n\\) (for \\(n \\neq -1\\)) \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\ln x + c\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\(-\\frac{1}{x} + c\\) \\(\\mathrm{e}^{ax}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\mathrm{e}^{ax} + c\\) The constant \\(c\\) is the “constant of integration”—it disappears when we use definite integrals with limits. 0.4.2 Definite Integrals When we integrate between specific limits: \\[\\int_a^b f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[F(x)\\right]_a^b = F(b) - F(a)\\] where \\(F(x)\\) is the antiderivative (indefinite integral) of \\(f(x)\\). 0.4.3 Example: Solving a Differential Equation by Separation of Variables A technique we will use repeatedly in this course is separation of variables. The idea is straightforward: if we have an equation relating \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\) to \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), we rearrange so that everything involving \\(y\\) is on one side and everything involving \\(x\\) is on the other, then integrate both sides. For example, suppose: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -ky\\] where \\(k\\) is a constant. We rearrange to separate the variables \\(y\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{y} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] Now we integrate both sides. On the left, we integrate with respect to \\(y\\) from the initial value \\(y_0\\) (at \\(t = 0\\)) to the value at time \\(t\\), which we call \\(y_t\\). On the right, we integrate with respect to \\(t\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\): \\[\\int_{y_0}^{y_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{y} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] The left-hand side is an integral of \\(1/y\\), which gives \\(\\ln y\\). The right-hand side is an integral of a constant: \\[\\left[\\ln y\\right]_{y_0}^{y_t} = \\left[-kt\\right]_0^t\\] Applying the limits: \\[\\ln y_t - \\ln y_0 = -kt\\] \\[\\ln y_t = \\ln y_0 - kt\\] Taking the exponential of both sides: \\[y_t = y_0 \\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\] We have solved the differential equation: if something decreases at a rate proportional to its current value, it decays exponentially. This result will appear in the very first lecture on reaction kinetics. 0.5 Additional Resources Your CH12004 notes — review the sections on differentiation and integration MASH (Mathematics Resources Centre) — offers drop-in support and online resources: https://www.bath.ac.uk/professional-services/mathematics-resources-centre-mash/ Textbooks: Introduction to Contextual Maths in Chemistry (Dickinson &amp; McKinley) Foundations of Science Mathematics (Sivia, Rhodes &amp; Rawlings) "],["introduction-to-chemical-kinetics.html", "Lecture 1 Introduction to Chemical Kinetics 1.1 Why Study Reaction Kinetics? 1.2 Describing How Concentrations Change with Time 1.3 Reaction Rates 1.4 Mass Balance 1.5 Rate Laws 1.6 Elementary Processes 1.7 Complex Reactions 1.8 Units of the Rate Constant 1.9 Key Concepts", " Lecture 1 Introduction to Chemical Kinetics 1.1 Why Study Reaction Kinetics? Chemistry is fundamentally concerned with change—the transformation of substances into new forms with different properties. When we mix reactants together, we want to know not just whether a reaction will occur, but how rapidly it will proceed. While thermodynamics provides powerful tools for determining whether a particular chemical change is favourable and what the final equilibrium composition will be, it tells us nothing about how quickly this equilibrium will be reached. A reaction may be thermodynamically favourable yet proceed so slowly that it appears not to happen at all. Consider the conversion of diamond to graphite—thermodynamically spontaneous at room temperature and pressure, yet the process occurs at such a negligible rate that diamonds remain stable for geological timescales. Conversely, some reactions reach equilibrium in fractions of a second. Chemical kinetics addresses these questions of reaction rates and mechanisms. Where thermodynamics concerns itself with the energy relationships that govern chemical equilibria, kinetics focuses on the rates of chemical processes and the molecular pathways by which they occur. Through kinetic analysis, we can determine how quickly reactants transform into products, what factors influence reaction speed, and what sequence of molecular events constitutes the reaction mechanism. The complementary nature of thermodynamics and kinetics provides a complete picture of chemical change: Thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction can occur and what the equilibrium state will be Kinetics tells us how fast we approach that equilibrium and by what molecular pathway Both perspectives are essential for understanding chemical processes—in laboratory settings, industrial applications, and natural systems. 1.2 Describing How Concentrations Change with Time Let us examine a simple reaction: the conversion of a reactant A into a product B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\] Figure 1.1: Time evolution of concentrations for the reaction A → B. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of reactant A decreases while the concentration of product B increases. At any time \\(t\\), the sum of the two concentrations equals the initial concentration of A (assuming we start with pure A). As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations of both species change. We track the progress of the reaction by monitoring concentrations as functions of time. Using square brackets to denote concentration (in mol dm\\(^{-3}\\)), we write these time-dependent concentrations as \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\). Starting from initial values at \\(t = 0\\), the system evolves toward its final state. The questions we might ask include: How much product B is present after time \\(t\\)? How long will it take for a certain percentage of A to convert to B? If we change pressure, temperature, or initial concentration, how will the reaction speed be affected? Answering these questions requires us to understand how reaction rates relate to concentrations—and this is the central concern of chemical kinetics. 1.3 Reaction Rates We quantify how quickly a reaction occurs in terms of the rate at which concentrations change with time. For our simple A → B reaction, the reaction rate can be expressed as either the rate of disappearance of A or the rate of appearance of B. If the rate were constant, calculating it would be straightforward—we would simply measure the change in concentration over a time interval: \\[\\text{change in [A] per unit time} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_{t_2} - [\\mathrm{A}]_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1} = \\frac{\\Delta[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\Delta t}\\] Figure 1.2: The reaction rate at any instant equals the slope of the tangent to the concentration-time curve at that point. For a reaction where the rate decreases over time (as reactant is consumed), the slope becomes less steep as the reaction progresses. In most cases, however, reaction rates are not constant—they change as the reaction progresses and reactant concentrations decrease. To capture the instantaneous rate at any moment, we use the derivative: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] The negative sign in the first expression ensures that the rate is a positive quantity, since \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) decreases with time (giving a negative derivative). By convention, reaction rates are always expressed as positive values. For reactions with more complex stoichiometry, the relationship between concentration changes requires appropriate stoichiometric factors. Consider a reaction where one molecule of A combines with two molecules of B to form one molecule of C: \\[\\mathrm{A} + 2\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] Figure 1.3: Concentration profiles for the reaction A + 2B → C. Species B is consumed twice as fast as A, reflecting the 2:1 stoichiometric ratio. The rate of formation of C equals the rate of consumption of A. Here, B is consumed twice as rapidly as A. To define a single, unambiguous reaction rate, we include stoichiometric factors: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, for a reaction with stoichiometry \\[\\nu_\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{A} + \\nu_\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{B} + \\ldots \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{P} + \\nu_\\mathrm{Q}\\mathrm{Q} + \\ldots\\] the rate is written as: \\[\\text{rate} = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{A}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{B}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\ldots = +\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{P}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{1}{\\nu_\\mathrm{Q}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{Q}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\ldots\\] But where do these stoichiometric factors come from? The answer lies in a fundamental principle: the conservation of mass. 1.4 Mass Balance Chemical reactions cannot create or destroy mass—they merely rearrange atoms into new configurations. This principle of mass conservation provides the foundation for understanding how the rates of change of different species are connected. Consider our simple reaction A → B. If each molecule of A converts into exactly one molecule of B, then at any time \\(t\\) the total number of molecules (and hence the total concentration) remains constant: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] If we start with pure A (so that \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\)), this simplifies to: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to time: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] since the initial concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) is a constant. Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This tells us that for this simple reaction, the rate of formation of B exactly equals the rate of consumption of A. Now consider a reaction where one molecule of A produces two molecules of B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{B}\\] Here, conservation of mass does not imply conservation of moles—we gain one mole of molecules for every mole of A that reacts. To write a mass balance, we note that each A molecule that reacts produces two B molecules. If we define our “conserved quantity” in terms of B-equivalents, then one A is worth two B, giving: \\[2[\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t = 2[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] Taking the derivative: \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0\\] Rearranging: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] This confirms that B is produced twice as fast as A is consumed—exactly what we expect from the stoichiometry. To define a single reaction rate that is independent of which species we monitor, we write: \\[\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] For any reaction, mass balance leads to the general expression: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species X (negative for reactants, positive for products). This relationship ensures that the reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) has the same numerical value regardless of which species we use to measure it. The units of reaction rate are concentration per unit time: mol dm\\(^{-3}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\). You should be able to: Given a balanced equation, write the reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) in terms of the rate of change of concentration of any species, including the correct stoichiometric factors. 1.5 Rate Laws The rates of chemical reactions typically depend on the concentrations of the reactants. The mathematical relationship between concentrations and rate is called a rate law. Many reactions follow a simple rate law where the rate is proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to some power: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b[\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] This expression contains several important quantities. The proportionality factor \\(k\\) is called the rate constant; it depends on temperature but not on concentration. The exponents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), etc. are called the order of reaction with respect to reactants A, B, C, etc., and their sum \\((a + b + c + \\ldots)\\) is the overall reaction order. Note that orders need not be integers—they can be zero, fractional, or even negative. An important point: the orders in a rate law need not reflect the stoichiometry of the overall reaction equation. For example: \\[\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{I}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HI} \\qquad \\nu = k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{I}_2]\\] Here the orders (both 1) happen to match the stoichiometric coefficients. But consider: \\[3\\mathrm{ClO}^- \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ClO}_3^- + 2\\mathrm{Cl}^- \\qquad \\nu = k[\\mathrm{ClO}^-]^2\\] The stoichiometric coefficient of ClO\\(^-\\) is 3, but the reaction is second order in ClO\\(^-\\). Some reactions exhibit rate laws that cannot be written in the simple power-law form at all. A classic example is the formation of hydrogen bromide: \\[\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr} \\qquad \\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1/2}}{1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]}\\] This reaction is first order with respect to H2, but the orders with respect to Br2 and HBr are undefined in the usual sense. The appearance of the product HBr in the denominator indicates that the product actually inhibits the reaction—a phenomenon we will explore later in the course. A complex rate law always implies a multistep reaction mechanism. 1.6 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of simple molecular-level steps called elementary processes (or elementary reactions). An elementary process represents a single molecular event—a transformation that cannot be broken down further. The molecularity of an elementary process describes how many reactant molecules participate in that single step. A unimolecular process involves a single molecule undergoing transformation—for example, isomerisation or decomposition. A bimolecular process requires two molecules to collide and react. Termolecular processes, where three molecules must collide simultaneously, are rare. Figure 1.4: Schematic representation of elementary processes classified by molecularity. Unimolecular processes involve a single molecule (e.g., isomerisation or decomposition). Bimolecular processes involve collision between two molecules. Termolecular processes, involving simultaneous three-body collisions, are rare. Termolecular processes are rare because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very low. When apparent third-order kinetics are observed, the mechanism usually involves sequential bimolecular steps rather than a true termolecular collision. For elementary processes—and only for elementary processes—the rate law directly reflects the molecularity: Molecularity Example Rate Law Unimolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\) Bimolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\) Bimolecular \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\) Termolecular \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\) \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\) This direct correspondence between molecularity and reaction order holds because an elementary process represents an actual molecular event. The rate depends on how frequently the required molecular encounters occur. For a unimolecular process, the rate depends only on how many A molecules are present. For a bimolecular process, the rate depends on how often A and B molecules collide—which is proportional to both \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\). 1.7 Complex Reactions Most reactions we encounter are not elementary processes but rather sequences of elementary steps. The H2 + Br2 reaction, for example, proceeds through a mechanism involving four elementary steps: \\(\\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br}\\) (unimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) (bimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\) (bimolecular) \\(\\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}_2\\) (bimolecular) Each elementary step follows a simple rate law determined by its molecularity. The overall rate law for the complex reaction emerges from how these steps combine—and this is why the overall rate law can be complicated. For complex reactions, we cannot deduce the rate law from the reaction stoichiometry alone. Rate laws for complex reactions must be determined empirically through analysis of experimental data. However, as we shall see, if we know (or hypothesise) the mechanism, we can predict the rate law—and comparing this prediction with experiment provides evidence for or against the proposed mechanism. 1.8 Units of the Rate Constant The units of a rate constant depend on the overall order of the reaction. Since both sides of a rate equation must have the same dimensions, we can deduce the units of \\(k\\) from dimensional analysis. For a first-order reaction (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)): \\[\\underbrace{\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\mathrm{\\,s}^{-1}}_{\\text{rate}} = [k] \\times \\underbrace{\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}}_{[\\mathrm{A}]}\\] so \\([k] = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). Repeating this analysis for other orders gives: Overall order Units of \\(k\\) 0 \\(\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) 1 \\(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) 2 \\(\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) 3 \\(\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) The general pattern for overall order \\(n\\) is: \\[[k] = \\mathrm{mol}^{1-n}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^{3(n-1)}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\] When comparing rate constants, always check that they refer to the same order of reaction—a rate constant of \\(10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) for a first-order reaction cannot be directly compared with a rate constant of \\(10^6\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) for a second-order reaction. You should be able to: Write the rate law for an elementary process given its molecularity, and determine the units of a rate constant given the overall reaction order. 1.9 Key Concepts Thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction can occur; kinetics tells us how fast it proceeds and by what molecular pathway. The reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) is defined as the rate of change of concentration, with stoichiometric factors ensuring a single unambiguous value regardless of which species we monitor. Mass balance (conservation of mass) provides the physical basis for the stoichiometric factors in rate expressions. A rate law describes how the rate depends on concentrations. The reaction orders need not match the stoichiometric coefficients. Elementary processes are single molecular events (unimolecular, bimolecular, or termolecular). Only for elementary processes do the orders directly reflect the molecularity. Complex reactions consist of sequences of elementary steps. Their rate laws must be determined experimentally. The units of a rate constant depend on the overall reaction order: for an \\(n\\)th-order reaction, \\([k] = \\mathrm{mol}^{1-n}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^{3(n-1)}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). In the next chapter, we will derive integrated rate laws that predict how concentrations evolve over time for reactions of different orders, and compare these predictions with experimental data. "],["integrated-rate-laws.html", "Lecture 2 Integrated Rate Laws 2.1 From Differential to Integrated Rate Laws 2.2 Zeroth-Order Reactions 2.3 First-Order Reactions 2.4 Second-Order Reactions 2.5 Summary and Graphical Analysis 2.6 Worked Example: Decomposition of Azomethane 2.7 Reactions with Two Different Reactants 2.8 Key Concepts", " Lecture 2 Integrated Rate Laws In the previous chapter, we defined reaction rates, wrote differential rate laws for elementary processes, and saw that the rate of a reaction generally depends on the concentrations of the reactants. These differential rate laws tell us the instantaneous rate at any given set of concentrations—but experimentally, what we usually measure is concentration as a function of time. To connect our differential rate laws to experimental data, we need to integrate them: converting a relationship between rate and concentration into a relationship between concentration and time. 2.1 From Differential to Integrated Rate Laws To integrate a differential rate law, we separate variables and integrate both sides between appropriate limits (using the techniques from the Mathematical Foundations chapter). This gives us the integrated rate law: an equation that tells us the concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) as a function of time. We then rearrange this into a linear form, suitable for graphical analysis, for reasons that will become clear once we have derived the results for several different reaction orders. Figure 2.1 summarises the results we will derive in this chapter for zeroth-, first-, and second-order reactions. Figure 2.1: Overview of the integrated rate laws derived in this chapter. For each reaction order, we start from the differential rate law, integrate to obtain the integrated rate law, and then rearrange into a linear form suitable for graphical analysis. 2.2 Zeroth-Order Reactions For a zeroth-order reaction, the rate is constant, independent of the concentration of the reactant: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\] Integrating both sides between \\(t = 0\\) (when \\([\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\)) and time \\(t\\) (when \\([\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_t\\)): \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] Rearranging gives the zeroth-order integrated rate law: \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] This is already in linear form: a plot of \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) against \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-k\\) and intercept \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Physically, a constant rate means the reaction proceeds at the same speed regardless of how much reactant remains—a situation that can arise, for example, when a reaction is limited by a saturated catalyst surface. Figure 2.2: Zeroth-order kinetics: plotting \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) versus \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-k\\) and intercept \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). 2.3 First-Order Reactions For a first-order reaction, the rate is proportional to the concentration of the reactant: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] We separate variables and integrate: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] \\[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt\\] This gives the first-order integrated rate law in linear form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] A plot of \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) against \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-k\\) and intercept \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Taking the exponential of both sides gives the equivalent exponential form: \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] This is the exponential decay we derived from general principles in the Mathematical Foundations chapter: whenever a quantity changes at a rate proportional to its current value, the result is an exponential function. First-order kinetics means the concentration decreases by the same fraction in each successive time interval. Figure 2.3: First-order kinetics: plotting \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]\\) versus \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-k\\) and intercept \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). 2.4 Second-Order Reactions For a second-order reaction in a single reactant (\\(2\\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\text{products}\\)): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\] Separating variables and integrating: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] \\[\\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] \\[-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt\\] Rearranging: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] A plot of \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) against \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(+k\\) and intercept \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Notice that the slope is positive here, unlike the zeroth- and first-order cases where it is negative. Figure 2.4: Second-order kinetics: plotting \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]\\) versus \\(t\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(+k\\) and intercept \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). You should be able to: Derive the integrated rate law for a zeroth-, first-, or second-order reaction starting from the differential rate law, using separation of variables and integration. 2.5 Summary and Graphical Analysis Now that we have worked through each derivation, the table below collects the key results previewed in Figure 2.1. Order Integrated form Linear plot Slope 0 \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(-k\\) 1 \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\) \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(-k\\) 2 \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt\\) \\(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]}\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(+k\\) Each reaction order predicts a different functional form for concentration as a function of time—a different curve shape. By rearranging each integrated rate law into a linear form, we can often distinguish consistent from inconsistent models by simple visual inspection: data that are consistent with a particular rate law will fall on a straight line in the corresponding plot, while data that are inconsistent will show a curve. We can therefore test candidate rate laws by plotting the same dataset in each of the three linear forms and seeing which (if any) gives a straight line. The slope of that line gives the rate constant (Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5: The linear form of the integrated rate law for each reaction order. In each case, concentration–time data that obey the corresponding rate law fall on a straight line, with the slope giving the rate constant and the intercept giving the initial concentration. Although we derived these integrated rate laws for elementary processes, the same graphical tests apply whenever a reaction follows a simple rate law of the form \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^n\\)—regardless of whether the underlying mechanism involves a single step or multiple steps. 2.6 Worked Example: Decomposition of Azomethane Let us apply the graphical analysis to a real dataset. The thermal decomposition of azomethane (CH3N2CH3) was studied at \\(2.18 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\) and \\(576\\,\\mathrm{K}\\), yielding the following concentration–time data: \\(t\\) / min 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) / \\(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\) 8.70 6.52 4.89 3.67 2.75 2.06 1.55 We can test each of the three integrated rate laws by plotting the data in the corresponding linear form (as illustrated in Figure 2.5). Plotting \\(\\ln[\\text{azomethane}]\\) against \\(t\\) gives a straight line, consistent with first-order kinetics, with slope \\(-k = -9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\). Plotting \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) against \\(t\\) or \\(1/[\\text{azomethane}]\\) against \\(t\\) would give curves rather than straight lines, ruling out zeroth- and second-order rate laws. In the next chapter, we will explore several complementary methods for determining rate laws from experimental data, returning to this dataset along the way. You should be able to: Test whether concentration–time data are consistent with a given reaction order by plotting in the appropriate linear form, and extract the rate constant from the slope. 2.7 Reactions with Two Different Reactants The integrated rate laws above all involve a single reactant species. For a reaction between two different species, \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\text{products}\\), the differential rate law is: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Integration is more complex here because the right-hand side contains two concentrations that both change with time. The problem can be solved analytically using mass balance (from Chapter 1) and partial fractions, giving the full integrated result: \\[\\begin{equation} kt = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_t / [\\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t / [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\right) \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] The derivation of this result is given in Appendix A. You are not expected to reproduce this derivation, but it is worth noting that the result requires \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\neq [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) (otherwise the denominator is zero). If the initial concentrations are equal, the problem reduces to the single-reactant second-order case (Eqn. (2.4)). A common and powerful simplification is to use one reactant in large excess. If \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\), then \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) remains effectively constant throughout the reaction, and the rate law simplifies to: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx -k&#39;[\\mathrm{A}] \\quad \\text{where } k&#39; = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] This is called a pseudo-first-order rate law: the reaction is second-order overall, but behaves as first-order under these conditions. We will explore the isolation method and pseudo-first-order kinetics fully in the next chapter. 2.8 Key Concepts Integrated rate laws relate concentration to time, connecting differential rate laws to experimentally measurable quantities. Each reaction order gives a different integrated rate law with a characteristic linear form. Plotting data in the appropriate linear form tests whether a given rate law is consistent with the data. A straight line confirms the proposed order; the slope gives the rate constant. For zeroth-order: \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) is linear (slope \\(-k\\)). For first-order: \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) is linear (slope \\(-k\\)). For second-order: \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) is linear (slope \\(+k\\)). First-order kinetics corresponds to exponential decay: \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\). Reactions between two different species can be simplified to pseudo-first-order kinetics by using one reactant in large excess.

We also saw that by plotting data in the appropriate linear form, we can test whether a given rate law is consistent with our measurements. But how do we carry out this analysis systematically? And what do we do when a reaction involves more than one reactant? In this chapter, we develop four complementary methods for determining rate laws from experimental data. 3.1 The Integral Method The integral method applies the graphical analysis we introduced in the previous chapter as a systematic procedure. Given concentration–time data for a reaction, we plot the data in each of the linear forms from the summary table (reproduced below for convenience) and look for the plot that gives a straight line. The order of that straight-line plot tells us the reaction order; the slope gives the rate constant. Order Linear plot Slope 0 \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(-k\\) 1 \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(-k\\) 2 \\(1/[\\mathrm{A}]\\) vs \\(t\\) \\(+k\\) 3.1.1 Worked Example: Azomethane Decomposition Revisited Returning to the azomethane decomposition data from the previous chapter, we now apply the integral method systematically. Recall the data: \\(t\\) / min 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 \\([\\text{azomethane}]\\) / \\(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,dm}^{-3}\\) 8.70 6.52 4.89 3.67 2.75 2.06 1.55 In the previous chapter, we plotted \\(\\ln[\\text{azomethane}]\\) against \\(t\\) and found a straight line with slope \\(-k = -9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\), consistent with first-order kinetics. But to be rigorous, we should also check that the data are not consistent with the other candidate rate laws. Plotting \\(1/[\\text{azomethane}]\\) against \\(t\\) gives a curve, not a straight line—ruling out second-order kinetics. Figure 3.1: Testing the azomethane data against second-order kinetics. Plotting \\(1/[\\mathrm{azomethane}]\\) versus time does not give a straight line, ruling out a second-order rate law. This is the essence of the integral method: we test each candidate rate law in turn and reject those that do not give a straight line. A linear plot both confirms the reaction order and provides the rate constant from the slope. You should be able to: Apply the integral method to concentration–time data: plot in the appropriate linear forms, identify which (if any) gives a straight line, and extract the rate constant from the slope. Aside: Modern Analysis Methods While we have focused on linear transformations, modern computational methods allow direct non-linear fitting of the integrated rate laws in their original (non-linearised) form. The linear analysis method remains the standard approach in most textbooks, however, and has the practical advantage that it can be applied with nothing more than graph paper and a ruler—or in an exam. 3.2 The Half-Life Method The half-life method provides a way to test for first-order kinetics without plotting a graph. It exploits a unique property of exponential functions: first-order kinetics gives exponential decay, and for an exponential decay the concentration always decreases by the same fraction in equal time intervals. If the concentration drops to 75% of its value in the first 30 minutes, it drops to 75% again in the next 30 minutes, and the next, regardless of the actual concentration. No other functional form has this property. 3.2.1 Deriving the Half-Life Recall from the previous chapter that for a first-order reaction: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\] The half-life (\\(t_{1/2}\\)) is the time taken for the concentration to fall to half its initial value. Setting \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\): \\[\\frac{1}{2}[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2} = \\mathrm{e}^{-kt_{1/2}}\\] Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: \\[\\begin{equation} t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{k} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Notice that \\(t_{1/2}\\) depends only on \\(k\\), not on \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). The half-life is constant: it takes the same amount of time for the concentration to halve whether we start from \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) or from any later concentration. This is a defining characteristic of first-order kinetics. 3.2.2 Generalisation: Constant Proportional Change There is nothing special about the factor of one-half. For a first-order reaction, the time taken for the concentration to fall to any fixed fraction \\(1/n\\) of its starting value is constant: \\[\\begin{equation} t_{1/n} = \\frac{\\ln n}{k} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] This follows because exponential decay means the concentration decreases by the same proportion in each successive time interval of equal length. If the concentration falls by a factor of 0.75 in the first 30 minutes, it falls by a factor of 0.75 in the next 30 minutes, and the next, and so on. Any constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics. 3.2.3 Worked Example: Azomethane Revisited We can use this as an independent check on the azomethane data. Looking at the ratio of successive concentrations, each measured at 30-minute intervals: Interval \\([\\text{azomethane}]_\\text{start}\\) \\([\\text{azomethane}]_\\text{end}\\) Ratio 0–30 min 8.70 6.52 0.75 30–60 min 6.52 4.89 0.75 60–90 min 4.89 3.67 0.75 90–120 min 3.67 2.75 0.75 120–150 min 2.75 2.06 0.75 150–180 min 2.06 1.55 0.75 The constant ratio of 0.75 confirms first-order kinetics—without plotting a single graph. From Eqn. (3.2) with \\(n = 1/0.75 = 4/3\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 30\\,\\mathrm{min}\\): \\[k = \\frac{\\ln(4/3)}{30\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 9.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\] This agrees with the value obtained from the integral method, as it should — both methods assume first-order kinetics and extract \\(k\\) from the same underlying exponential. The half-life method is less precise than the graphical method (it relies on reading individual data points rather than fitting a line through all the data), but it provides a quick and intuitive test that does not require plotting. You should be able to: Derive the first-order half-life expression \\(t_{1/2} = \\ln 2/k\\), and use constant proportional change in concentration–time data to test for first-order kinetics. 3.3 The Isolation Method The integral and half-life methods work well for reactions involving a single reactant, but many reactions involve two or more species. Consider a reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\text{products}\\) with rate law: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta\\] The rate depends on both \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\), which both change with time. How can we determine the partial orders \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) separately? The isolation method simplifies the problem by making all but one reactant effectively constant. If we use B in large excess (\\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\)), then B is consumed in negligible proportion during the reaction and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) throughout. The rate law becomes: \\[\\nu = k&#39;[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha \\quad \\text{where } k&#39; = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0^\\beta\\] The reaction now behaves as if it depends only on \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), with a pseudo-rate constant \\(k&#39;\\) that absorbs the (constant) concentration of B — a pseudo-\\(\\alpha\\)th-order rate law. In the previous chapter, we saw the specific case where \\(\\alpha = 1\\), which gives pseudo-first-order kinetics. We can now apply the integral method or half-life method to determine \\(\\alpha\\). To find \\(\\beta\\), we repeat the experiment with A in large excess (\\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\gg [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\)). Now \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) and: \\[\\nu = k&#39;&#39;[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta \\quad \\text{where } k&#39;&#39; = k[\\mathrm{A}]_0^\\alpha\\] Applying the integral method to this simplified rate law gives \\(\\beta\\). 3.3.1 Extracting the True Rate Constant The isolation method also provides a route to the true rate constant \\(k\\). Taking logarithms of \\(k&#39; = k[\\mathrm{B}]_0^\\beta\\): \\[\\ln k&#39; = \\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] By repeating the experiment at several different values of \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) (each still in large excess over \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\)), we obtain a set of pseudo-rate constants \\(k&#39;\\). A plot of \\(\\ln k&#39;\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(\\beta\\) and intercept \\(\\ln k\\). You should be able to: Explain how the isolation method simplifies a multi-reactant rate law, and use the relationship \\(\\ln k&#39; = \\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) to determine a partial order from pseudo-rate constants. 3.4 The Differential Method (Initial Rates) The methods above all work with concentration–time data collected over the full course of a reaction. The differential method takes a different approach: it works directly with rates rather than concentrations. Starting from a general rate law: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^\\alpha[\\mathrm{B}]^\\beta\\] taking logarithms gives: \\[\\ln\\nu = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}] + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]\\] If we could measure the rate \\(\\nu\\) at known concentrations of A and B, we could determine \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) directly. But rate is an instantaneous quantity—how do we measure it? The practical solution is to use initial rates. At \\(t = 0\\), we know the concentrations exactly (they are just the starting concentrations we prepared), and we can estimate the initial rate \\(\\nu_0\\) from the initial slope of the concentration–time curve. This gives: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = \\ln k + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0 + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\] If we hold \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) constant and vary \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) across a series of experiments, the \\(\\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) term is the same in every experiment, and we can write: \\[\\ln\\nu_0 = (\\ln k + \\beta\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0) + \\alpha\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\] A plot of \\(\\ln\\nu_0\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(\\alpha\\). Repeating with \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) held constant and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) varied gives \\(\\beta\\) in the same way. You should be able to: Use the method of initial rates to determine reaction orders from a series of experiments with varying starting concentrations. 3.5 Key Concepts The integral method tests candidate rate laws by plotting concentration–time data in different linear forms. A straight line confirms the proposed order; a curve rules it out. The slope gives the rate constant. The half-life for a first-order reaction is \\(t_{1/2} = \\ln 2/k\\), independent of initial concentration. More generally, constant proportional change over equal time intervals is diagnostic of first-order kinetics. The isolation method simplifies multi-reactant kinetics by using one reactant in large excess, reducing the rate law to a pseudo-order form in the remaining reactant. Repeating isolation experiments at different excess concentrations and plotting \\(\\ln k&#39;\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) determines both the partial order \\(\\beta\\) and the true rate constant \\(k\\). The differential method (initial rates) determines reaction orders by measuring \\(\\nu_0\\) at different starting concentrations. A plot of \\(\\ln\\nu_0\\) versus \\(\\ln[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) (at constant \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0\\)) gives slope \\(\\alpha\\). These four methods are complementary: the integral and half-life methods work best for single-reactant systems, while the isolation and differential methods handle multi-reactant systems. "],["complex-reaction-mechanisms.html", "Lecture 4 Complex Reaction Mechanisms 4.1 Consecutive Reactions 4.2 Equilibrium Reactions 4.3 Pre-Equilibrium Mechanisms 4.4 Key Concepts", " Lecture 4 Complex Reaction Mechanisms So far, we have focused on reactions that can be described by a single rate law involving a single reactant. But most chemical reactions proceed through multiple elementary steps, often involving intermediate species that are formed and then consumed during the reaction. In this chapter, we develop the tools for analysing these more complex mechanisms: consecutive reactions, equilibrium reactions, and pre-equilibrium mechanisms. 4.1 Consecutive Reactions Consider a reaction in which A is converted to a final product C, but not directly — instead, it proceeds through an intermediate B: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] This is a consecutive reaction (or sequential reaction): the product of the first step becomes the reactant for the second. The overall mechanism consists of two elementary processes, each with its own rate constant. To analyse the kinetics, we write a differential rate equation for each species. The intermediate B participates in both steps — it is produced by the first and consumed by the second — so its rate equation has two terms: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_2[\\mathrm{B}]\\] The first equation is just first-order decay of A — we already know how to solve this. The equation for B is more involved: it depends on both \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\). But since we can solve the first equation independently, we can substitute the result into the second. 4.1.1 Solving the Rate Equations Starting with the initial conditions \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\), \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\), \\([\\mathrm{C}]_0 = 0\\): The equation for A is a simple first-order decay, giving: \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-k_1t}\\] Substituting this into the equation for B gives a linear first-order differential equation whose solution is: \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{k_1}{k_2 - k_1}[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-k_1t} - \\mathrm{e}^{-k_2t}\\right) \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] The derivation of this result requires techniques beyond this course and is not examinable — what matters is understanding the form of the solution and its physical meaning. The concentration of B is a difference of two exponentials: one representing its formation from A and the other its consumption to form C. This means \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) starts at zero, rises to a maximum, and then falls back to zero as B is consumed — the characteristic rise-and-fall profile of a reactive intermediate. For C, we use mass balance: since every molecule of A must end up as either A, B, or C, we have \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\), which gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1 + \\frac{k_1\\mathrm{e}^{-k_2t} - k_2\\mathrm{e}^{-k_1t}}{k_2 - k_1}\\right)\\] Figure 4.1: Concentration profiles for the consecutive reaction A → B → C. The reactant A decays exponentially. The intermediate B rises to a maximum then falls. The product C increases monotonically towards \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). 4.1.2 The Rate-Determining Step The behaviour of a consecutive reaction depends critically on the relative magnitudes of \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\). Two limiting cases emerge, each with a clear physical interpretation. When \\(k_1 \\gg k_2\\) (fast first step, slow second step): A is consumed rapidly and B builds up to a high concentration before slowly converting to C. The overall rate of product formation is controlled by the slow second step — the first step “waits” for the second to catch up. In this limit, the expression for \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t\\) simplifies to: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-k_2t}\\right)\\] The rate depends on \\(k_2\\) but not on \\(k_1\\): making the first step even faster does not speed up the overall reaction. Figure 4.2: Concentration profiles when \\(k_1 \\gg k_2\\). The intermediate B builds up rapidly and then decays slowly. The second step is rate-determining: the overall rate depends on \\(k_2\\) but not on \\(k_1\\). When \\(k_1 \\ll k_2\\) (slow first step, fast second step): A is consumed slowly, and B is converted to C almost as soon as it forms — so B never accumulates to a significant concentration. The overall rate is controlled by the slow first step. In this limit: \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_t \\approx [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-k_1t}\\right)\\] Now the rate depends on \\(k_1\\) but not on \\(k_2\\): making the second step even faster does not help. Figure 4.3: Concentration profiles when \\(k_1 \\ll k_2\\). The intermediate B remains at low concentration throughout because it is consumed almost as fast as it forms. The first step is rate-determining. In both cases, the overall rate is governed by the slower step. This is the rate-determining step (or rate-limiting step): the slowest step in a multi-step mechanism, which acts as a bottleneck controlling the overall rate of reaction. You can identify it from the concentration profiles: it is the step whose rate constant appears in the simplified expression for \\([\\mathrm{C}]_t\\). You should be able to: Write differential rate equations for each species in a consecutive reaction A → B → C, describe qualitatively how the concentrations of reactant, intermediate, and product evolve with time, and identify the rate-determining step from the relative magnitudes of \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\). 4.2 Equilibrium Reactions Not all reactions go to completion. Many reach a dynamic equilibrium in which the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, so the concentrations no longer change with time. Consider the simplest case: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B}\\] The rate equations now include both the forward and reverse processes: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]\\] At equilibrium, the concentrations stop changing: \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]/\\mathrm{d}t = 0\\). Setting the rate equation for A equal to zero: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq} = k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{eq}\\] Rearranging: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{eq}}{[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = K_\\mathrm{eq} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is a remarkable result. The equilibrium constant \\(K_\\mathrm{eq}\\) — which you will have met in thermodynamics as a ratio of concentrations at equilibrium — is here shown to equal the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants. This connects kinetics (how fast reactions go) with thermodynamics (where the equilibrium lies). A large \\(K_\\mathrm{eq}\\) means the forward rate constant is much larger than the reverse: equilibrium lies to the right, favouring products. A small \\(K_\\mathrm{eq}\\) means the reverse reaction dominates: equilibrium lies to the left, favouring reactants. This relationship is general: for any elementary equilibrium, the equilibrium constant equals the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants. It tells us that thermodynamic equilibrium is not a static state — it is a dynamic balance between opposing kinetic processes. You should be able to: Write rate equations for a reversible reaction, derive the relationship \\(K_\\mathrm{eq} = k_1/k_{-1}\\) by setting the net rate to zero, and explain the connection between kinetics and thermodynamics. 4.3 Pre-Equilibrium Mechanisms We now combine the ideas of consecutive and equilibrium reactions. Consider a mechanism in which a fast, reversible first step establishes an equilibrium involving an intermediate C, which then slowly converts to products: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] The rate equations for this mechanism are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\] In general, these equations cannot be solved analytically — they require numerical integration. But a powerful simplification is possible when \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\): the reverse reaction of the first step is much faster than the forward reaction of the second step. Under these conditions, the first step reaches equilibrium long before a significant amount of D has been formed. The intermediate C is in equilibrium with A and B, even as it is slowly drained away by the second step. This is a pre-equilibrium. Figure 4.4: Concentration profiles for the pre-equilibrium mechanism A + B ⇌ C → D. The intermediate C rapidly reaches a quasi-equilibrium concentration, then slowly depletes as product D forms. Since the first step is effectively at equilibrium, we can write: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{C}]}{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = K\\] which gives: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] The overall rate of product formation is then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}] = k_2K[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] The result is a second-order rate law, even though the mechanism involves three elementary steps. The observed rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1k_2/k_{-1}\\) combines the individual rate constants from all three steps. This is a common outcome of pre-equilibrium mechanisms: the rate law looks simple, but the effective rate constant encodes information about the underlying multi-step mechanism. The pre-equilibrium approximation applies whenever the first step equilibrates much faster than the second step proceeds — that is, when \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\). If this condition is not met, we need a different approach. In the next chapter, we introduce the steady-state approximation, which provides a more general method for handling reactive intermediates and which reduces to the pre-equilibrium result as a special case. You should be able to: Identify when a pre-equilibrium approximation is appropriate, apply it to derive an overall rate law, and explain why the observed rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1k_2/k_{-1}\\) depends on the rate constants of all three elementary steps. 4.4 Key Concepts Consecutive reactions (A → B → C) involve intermediate species whose concentration rises then falls. Writing rate equations for each species requires tracking which steps produce and consume each species. The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a multi-step mechanism. It acts as a bottleneck: the overall rate depends on the rate constant of this step, not the faster steps. For equilibrium reactions, setting the net rate to zero gives \\(K_\\mathrm{eq} = k_1/k_{-1}\\), connecting kinetics (rate constants) to thermodynamics (the equilibrium constant). A pre-equilibrium mechanism arises when a fast reversible step establishes equilibrium before a slower step forms products. The approximation requires \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\). The pre-equilibrium approximation gives a simple overall rate law whose observed rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1k_2/k_{-1}\\) encodes information about all the elementary steps. These methods provide the foundation for the steady-state approximation (next chapter), which generalises the treatment of reactive intermediates.

But what if this condition is not met? What if the intermediate C is consumed so rapidly that it never has time to reach equilibrium with the reactants? We need a more general method — one that works regardless of the relative magnitudes of the rate constants. This is the steady-state approximation (SSA). 5.1 The Idea Behind the Steady-State Approximation A reactive intermediate is a species that is formed during a reaction and then consumed before the reaction is complete. It does not appear in the overall balanced equation. In many mechanisms, reactive intermediates are highly unstable: they are consumed almost as fast as they are produced, so their concentration remains small throughout the reaction. The steady-state approximation exploits this observation. If an intermediate I is produced and consumed at similar rates, then after a brief initial period its concentration will reach a nearly constant value — a steady state. Mathematically, we express this as: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0\\] This does not mean that \\([\\mathrm{I}] = 0\\). The intermediate is present — it must be, because the reaction proceeds through it — but its concentration changes so slowly compared to the other species that we can treat \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]/\\mathrm{d}t\\) as approximately zero. This single approximation converts a set of coupled differential equations into an algebraic problem that we can solve by hand. The approximation is valid when the intermediate reaches its steady-state concentration quickly compared to the timescale of the overall reaction, and when the intermediate’s concentration remains small compared to those of the reactants and products. In practice, this means the intermediate must be reactive — it must be consumed rapidly by one or more subsequent steps. Figure 5.1: When \\(k_1 \\ll k_2\\) in a consecutive reaction A → B → C, the intermediate B remains at a low, nearly constant concentration throughout — a steady state. The SSA approximates this by setting \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]/\\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0\\). [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 5.2 Worked Example: A + B ⇌ C → D Let us apply the SSA to a mechanism we have already met: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] In Lecture 4, we analysed this mechanism using the pre-equilibrium approximation, which required \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\). The SSA makes no such assumption — it requires only that C is a short-lived intermediate whose concentration quickly reaches a steady state. 5.2.1 Setting Up the Rate Equations The rate equations for each species are: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\end{align*}\\] The intermediate C has two routes for consumption: it can revert to A + B (rate \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}]\\)) or proceed to D (rate \\(k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\)). The competition between these two fates is what makes the general problem difficult — and what the SSA allows us to handle. 5.2.2 Applying the SSA We apply the steady-state approximation to C by setting \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]/\\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0\\): \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{C}] - k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\approx 0\\] Rearranging to solve for the steady-state concentration of C: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[\\mathrm{C}]\\] \\[[\\mathrm{C}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\] The overall rate of product formation is then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{C}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\frac{k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] This is the general SSA rate law for this mechanism. It is second order overall (first order in A, first order in B), with an effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1 k_2/(k_{-1} + k_2)\\). 5.2.3 Limiting Cases The power of Eqn. (5.1) is that it contains the pre-equilibrium result as a special case, while also describing the opposite extreme. The behaviour is controlled by the denominator \\(k_{-1} + k_2\\) — specifically, by which term dominates. Pre-equilibrium limit (\\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\)): When the reverse of the first step is much faster than the second step, \\(k_{-1}\\) dominates in the denominator: \\[\\nu \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] This is exactly the pre-equilibrium rate law we derived in Lecture 4 (Eqn. (4.3)). Physically, C reverts to A + B many times before occasionally proceeding to D. The first step has time to reach equilibrium, and the slow second step controls the overall rate. The effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1 k_2/k_{-1}\\) depends on all three elementary rate constants. Forward-committed limit (\\(k_2 \\gg k_{-1}\\)): When the second step is much faster than the reverse of the first step, \\(k_2\\) dominates in the denominator: \\[\\nu \\approx k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] Now the overall rate depends only on \\(k_1\\). Once C is formed, it proceeds to D so rapidly that reversion to A + B is negligible — C is effectively committed to going forward. The first step is rate-determining, and the rate law is simply the rate of the first elementary step. Notice that the two limits give the same functional form (both are second order in A and B) but different effective rate constants: \\(k_1 k_2/k_{-1}\\) in the pre-equilibrium limit and \\(k_1\\) in the forward-committed limit. Figure 5.2: Concentration profiles for A + B ⇌ C → D. Left: pre-equilibrium limit where C builds up to an appreciable steady-state concentration. Right: forward-committed limit where C remains at very low concentration. The dashed line shows the SSA prediction for [D], which closely matches the exact solution. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] You should be able to: Apply the steady-state approximation to the mechanism A + B ⇌ C → D by setting \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]/\\mathrm{d}t = 0\\), derive the general rate law \\(\\nu = k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]/(k_{-1} + k_2)\\), and show that the pre-equilibrium result is recovered when \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\). 5.3 A Second Example: A ⇌ B, B + C → D To see how the SSA handles a different type of mechanism — and to illustrate how it can produce rate laws with no simple reaction order — consider: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{B} \\qquad \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{D}\\] Here, A isomerises reversibly to form a reactive intermediate B, which then reacts with a second species C to give the product D. The overall rate of product formation is \\(\\nu = k_2[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\), but since B is a reactive intermediate we cannot measure \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) directly. We need to express \\(\\nu\\) in terms of the stable, measurable species A and C. 5.3.1 Applying the SSA to B The rate equation for B is: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}] - k_2[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{C}]\\] Setting this to zero: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{B}](k_{-1} + k_2[\\mathrm{C}])\\] \\[[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{-1} + k_2[\\mathrm{C}]}\\] Substituting into the rate of product formation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k_2[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{ss}[\\mathrm{C}] = \\frac{k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{C}]}{k_{-1} + k_2[\\mathrm{C}]} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law has a striking feature: \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator. As a result, the rate is not simply proportional to \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) — there is no well-defined order with respect to C. (The rate is, however, always first order in A.) This is a good example of a mechanism that gives rise to a rate law that cannot be expressed as a simple power law \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^m[\\mathrm{C}]^n\\). 5.3.2 Limiting Cases Once again, the denominator controls the behaviour, but now the comparison is between \\(k_{-1}\\) and \\(k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\) — and this depends on the concentration of C, not just on rate constants. When \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2[\\mathrm{C}]\\) (pre-equilibrium limit): \\[\\nu \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{C}]\\] The reaction is first order in A, first order in C, and second order overall. Physically, B reverts to A many times before it encounters a molecule of C. The first step is at equilibrium, and the second step is rate-determining. The effective rate constant is \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1 k_2/k_{-1} = Kk_2\\), where \\(K = k_1/k_{-1}\\) is the equilibrium constant for the first step. When \\(k_2[\\mathrm{C}] \\gg k_{-1}\\) (forward-committed limit): \\[\\nu \\approx k_1[\\mathrm{A}]\\] The reaction is first order in A and zero order in C — the rate does not depend on \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) at all. This may seem surprising, but the physical explanation is clear: when \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) is high, every molecule of B that forms reacts with C almost immediately. The bottleneck is the rate at which B is produced from A, so further increasing \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) has no effect. This is an example of saturation kinetics: the rate reaches a plateau at high \\([\\mathrm{C}]\\) because the rate-determining step does not involve C. This transition from second-order to saturation behaviour — where the reaction order with respect to a species changes depending on its concentration — is characteristic of mechanisms with competing fates for a reactive intermediate. We will encounter the same pattern again in Lecture 7 (unimolecular reactions) and Lecture 8 (enzyme kinetics). Figure 5.3: Saturation kinetics: at low concentrations the rate increases linearly (first-order behaviour), but at high concentrations the rate approaches a plateau (zero-order behaviour). This transition is characteristic of mechanisms where a reactive intermediate has competing fates. The same mathematical form appears in enzyme kinetics (Lecture 8). [Draft figure from lecture slides.] You should be able to: Apply the SSA to a mechanism with a reactive intermediate (such as A ⇌ B, B + C → D), derive the resulting rate law, and identify the limiting cases by examining which terms dominate in the denominator. 5.4 SSA versus Pre-Equilibrium We have now seen two methods for handling reactive intermediates: the pre-equilibrium approximation (Lecture 4) and the steady-state approximation. How do they compare? The pre-equilibrium approximation assumes that the first step genuinely reaches equilibrium before the slow step proceeds. This requires \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\): the reverse reaction of the first step must be much faster than the forward reaction of the second step. It gives a simple derivation and a clear physical picture, but applies only in this specific limit. The steady-state approximation is more general. It assumes only that the intermediate’s concentration reaches a quasi-steady value — which can happen whether or not the first step is at equilibrium. The SSA works across a broader range of conditions and reduces to the pre-equilibrium result when \\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\). In practice: if you are told (or can justify) that the first step is a fast equilibrium, the pre-equilibrium approach is quicker and gives the same answer. If no such information is given, or if you need a result that covers different limiting cases, use the SSA. In Lecture 7, we will put the SSA to work on a real chemical problem — the Lindemann mechanism for unimolecular reactions — where it provides a beautifully simple explanation of how a molecule in a gas can acquire enough energy to decompose. 5.5 Key Concepts The steady-state approximation (SSA) sets \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]/\\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0\\) for a reactive intermediate I. This does not mean \\([\\mathrm{I}] = 0\\) — it means \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) is approximately constant after a brief initial transient. Applying the SSA converts coupled differential equations into algebraic equations, allowing us to express the rate law in terms of stable, measurable species only. For the mechanism A + B ⇌ C → D, the SSA gives \\(\\nu = k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]/(k_{-1} + k_2)\\), which contains both the pre-equilibrium limit (\\(k_{-1} \\gg k_2\\)) and the forward-committed limit (\\(k_2 \\gg k_{-1}\\)) as special cases. Some mechanisms produce rate laws where a species appears in both the numerator and denominator, giving no well-defined reaction order. The SSA naturally captures this behaviour. Saturation kinetics — where the rate becomes independent of a reactant’s concentration at high concentrations — arises when the rate-determining step does not involve that reactant. The SSA is more general than the pre-equilibrium approximation and reduces to it as a special case. Use the SSA when the relative magnitudes of rate constants are unknown or when a general result is needed. "],["unimolecular-reactions-and-collision-dynamics.html", "Lecture 6 Unimolecular Reactions and Collision Dynamics 6.1 The Lindemann–Hinshelwood Mechanism 6.2 Third-Order Reactions and Collision Dynamics 6.3 Key Concepts", " Lecture 6 Unimolecular Reactions and Collision Dynamics In the preceding chapters, we developed the steady-state approximation as a general tool for deriving rate laws from complex mechanisms. We now put it to work on real chemical problems. In this chapter, we tackle two puzzles that cannot be resolved without thinking carefully about elementary steps: how can a unimolecular reaction show pressure-dependent kinetics, and why do some apparently simple reactions require a third body to proceed? 6.1 The Lindemann–Hinshelwood Mechanism Many reactions that appear simple at first glance actually proceed through complex mechanisms involving multiple elementary steps. A classic example is the thermal decomposition of azomethane: \\[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_6} + \\mathrm{N_2}\\] At high pressures, this reaction exhibits first-order kinetics: \\[-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]\\] This simple rate law presents us with a fundamental mechanistic puzzle. We observe two seemingly contradictory behaviours: The reaction shows first-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\)), suggesting each molecule reacts independently. The rate increases with temperature, indicating that energy is required to overcome an activation barrier. But how does each molecule acquire this activation energy? If the activation energy came from molecular collisions (the usual mechanism for thermal activation), we would expect the rate to depend on the frequency of these collisions. Since collision frequency is proportional to the concentration of both colliding species, this would lead to second-order kinetics (\\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\)). Yet we observe first-order behaviour. Something more subtle must be going on. Figure 6.1: The unimolecular reaction paradox: the thermal decomposition of azomethane shows first-order kinetics at high pressure, yet the rate increases with temperature, implying collisional activation — which would suggest second-order kinetics. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 6.1.1 The Mechanism In 1921, Frederick Lindemann proposed a three-step mechanism to resolve this paradox: Step 1 — Excitation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Step 2 — Deactivation by collision: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Step 3 — Unimolecular decomposition: \\[\\mathrm{A^*} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{P}\\] Here, M represents any collision partner (often the reactant molecule itself), and A* represents an energetically excited molecule that has acquired enough energy to react. The key insight is that activation (Step 1) and reaction (Step 3) are separate events. A molecule can be activated by one collision, then react at a later time — or it may lose its energy in another collision (Step 2) before it has a chance to react. Figure 6.2: The Lindemann mechanism: (1) A is excited by collision with M; (2) A* can be deactivated by a further collision; (3) A* decomposes unimolecularly to products. The SSA is applied to the reactive intermediate A*. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 6.1.2 Applying the Steady-State Approximation The excited molecule A* is a reactive intermediate — it is formed by Step 1 and consumed by Steps 2 and 3. Applying the SSA: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A^*}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A^*}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}] \\approx 0\\] Solving for \\([\\mathrm{A^*}]\\): \\[[\\mathrm{A^*}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2}\\] The overall rate of product formation is then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k_2[\\mathrm{A^*}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\frac{k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] This is the Lindemann rate law. Notice that it has exactly the same mathematical structure as the SSA rate laws we derived in Lecture 5 (Eqn. (5.1)) — a ratio with competing terms in the denominator. The behaviour depends on which term dominates. For the specific case of azomethane decomposition, where the reactant itself acts as the collision partner (M = A): \\[\\nu = \\frac{k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}]^2}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_2}\\] 6.1.3 Pressure Dependence The denominator of Eqn. (6.1) contains \\([\\mathrm{M}]\\), which is proportional to pressure. This gives the Lindemann mechanism a distinctive pressure dependence — the apparent reaction order changes with pressure. High-pressure limit (\\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\gg k_2\\)): At high pressures, collisions are frequent and deactivation is much faster than decomposition. The denominator is dominated by \\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}]\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] The reaction is first order in A, with an effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{eff} = k_1 k_2/k_{-1}\\). This explains the observed first-order kinetics at high pressures. Physically: excited molecules are produced and deactivated many times before any one of them happens to decompose. The rate-determining step is the unimolecular decomposition of A, and the concentration of A is maintained at its equilibrium value by the fast excitation–deactivation equilibrium. Low-pressure limit (\\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\ll k_2\\)): At low pressures, collisions are rare. Once a molecule is excited, it decomposes before it encounters another molecule that could deactivate it. The denominator is dominated by \\(k_2\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\approx k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] The reaction is second order — first order in A and first order in M. The rate-determining step is now the excitation collision (Step 1), because every excited molecule goes on to react. This prediction was experimentally verified in 1927, providing strong support for the Lindemann mechanism. The Lindemann mechanism thus resolves the unimolecular paradox: the reaction is activated by collisions, but at high pressures the excitation–deactivation equilibrium is so fast that it is invisible to the experimenter. The observed kinetics reflect only the slow unimolecular decomposition step. Figure 6.3: The Lindemann rate law at high pressure: when collisional deactivation is much faster than unimolecular reaction (\\(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\gg k_2\\)), the reaction is first order with effective rate constant \\(k_1 k_2/k_{-1}\\). [Draft figure from lecture slides.] You should be able to: Apply the SSA to the Lindemann mechanism to derive the rate law \\(\\nu = k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]/(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2)\\), and predict the reaction order at high and low pressures by identifying which term dominates in the denominator. 6.2 Third-Order Reactions and Collision Dynamics 6.2.1 The NO Oxidation Puzzle Some reactions exhibit third-order kinetics, such as the oxidation of nitric oxide: \\[2\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] with rate law: \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}]\\] A termolecular collision mechanism — in which two NO molecules and one O2 molecule must collide simultaneously — seems implausible. Simultaneous three-body collisions are extremely rare events. Moreover, this reaction has the unusual property that its rate decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting a more complex mechanism. A pre-equilibrium mechanism provides a much better explanation: \\[\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{NO} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} (\\mathrm{NO})_2\\] \\[(\\mathrm{NO})_2 + \\mathrm{O_2} \\xrightarrow{k_2} 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] At equilibrium: \\[K = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{[(\\mathrm{NO})_2]}{[\\mathrm{NO}]^2}\\] The overall rate is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k_2[(\\mathrm{NO})_2][\\mathrm{O_2}] = k_2 K[\\mathrm{NO}]^2[\\mathrm{O_2}] \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] This mechanism explains two key observations. First, the third-order kinetics: the rate depends on \\([\\mathrm{NO}]^2\\) (from the equilibrium expression) and \\([\\mathrm{O_2}]\\) (from the slow step), giving overall third-order behaviour without requiring a termolecular collision. Second, the negative temperature dependence: the dimerisation equilibrium in the first step is exothermic, so increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (Le Chatelier’s principle), reducing \\([(\\mathrm{NO})_2]\\) and hence slowing the overall reaction. The effective rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K\\) decreases with temperature because \\(K\\) decreases faster than \\(k_2\\) increases. 6.2.2 Formation of Ozone: Why a Third Body is Needed Another important third-order reaction is ozone formation: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_3} + \\mathrm{M}\\] with rate law: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k[\\mathrm{O}][\\mathrm{O_2}][\\mathrm{M}] \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] where M represents a third body — any molecule present in the gas (typically N2 or O2). Why is a third body needed for this apparently simple combination reaction? The requirement arises from two fundamental constraints of molecular collisions: Energy conservation. The formation of ozone is highly exothermic, releasing approximately \\(107\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}\\) when the new O–O bond forms. A bimolecular collision between O and O2 produces a vibrationally excited ozone molecule, O3*, that contains all this excess energy in its vibrational modes. Momentum conservation. When O collides with O2, the total momentum of the system must be conserved. This constrains how the released energy is distributed: much of it ends up as internal vibrational energy of the O3* product rather than translational kinetic energy. The resulting O3* is so highly excited that it rapidly dissociates back to O + O2 — unless something removes the excess energy first. Figure 6.4: A bimolecular collision between O and O\\(_2\\) produces a vibrationally excited O\\(_3^*\\). Conservation of momentum and energy means the excess energy ends up as internal vibration, causing O\\(_3^*\\) to dissociate unless a third body M removes the energy. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] This is where the third body becomes essential. When the vibrationally excited O3* collides with M, the excess energy can be transferred to M as translational kinetic energy, allowing the ozone molecule to stabilise: Step 1 — Formation of excited ozone: \\[\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{O_3^*}\\] Step 2 — Collisional stabilisation: \\[\\mathrm{O_3^*} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{O_3} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Applying a pre-equilibrium approximation to O3* yields the observed third-order rate law (Eqn. (6.5)), with \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K = k_1 k_2/k_{-1}\\). The necessity for a third body illustrates a general principle: highly exothermic reactions involving small molecules (with few internal degrees of freedom to absorb the energy) often cannot proceed as simple bimolecular encounters. A third-body collision provides the mechanism to remove excess energy, allowing the product to survive. This explains why third-order kinetics are common in atmospheric chemistry and combustion, where small radicals and atoms frequently combine. Appendix B explores why most other bimolecular reactions don’t require a third body, despite the same conservation laws applying to all collisions. You should be able to: Explain why a termolecular collision is implausible for the NO oxidation reaction, write a pre-equilibrium mechanism that reproduces the observed third-order rate law, and explain why ozone formation requires a third body. 6.3 Key Concepts The Lindemann–Hinshelwood mechanism resolves the unimolecular reaction paradox: activation occurs by collision (Step 1), but at high pressures the excitation–deactivation equilibrium is fast, making only the slow unimolecular decomposition visible. Applying the SSA to A* gives the Lindemann rate law, \\(\\nu = k_1 k_2[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}]/(k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_2)\\), which predicts a transition from first-order to second-order kinetics as the pressure decreases. Third-order rate laws do not imply termolecular collisions. Pre-equilibrium mechanisms involving two sequential bimolecular steps can produce apparent third-order kinetics. The negative temperature dependence of the NO oxidation arises because the pre-equilibrium constant \\(K\\) decreases with temperature faster than \\(k_2\\) increases. Highly exothermic association reactions often require a third body to carry away excess energy from a vibrationally excited intermediate. Without this energy transfer, the product dissociates back to reactants. The SSA and pre-equilibrium approximation, developed in Lectures 4 and 5, are essential tools for understanding real reaction mechanisms — from gas-phase decomposition to atmospheric chemistry.

In this chapter, we apply the same mathematical framework to a very different setting: the kinetics of binding. When a substrate binds to an enzyme, or a gas molecule adsorbs onto a surface, the resulting kinetics share a common mathematical structure — saturation kinetics — that arises from the competition between binding and reaction at a finite number of sites. 7.1 Enzyme Kinetics Enzymes are biological catalysts — predominantly proteins — that dramatically accelerate reaction rates by lowering activation energies. Their three-dimensional structures create active sites: specific binding pockets where substrate molecules bind and undergo transformation into products. This specificity gives enzymes their remarkable selectivity, often catalysing just one reaction among many possibilities. Figure 7.1: Schematic representation of enzyme-substrate binding. The enzyme’s active site accommodates the substrate molecule, forming the enzyme-substrate complex ES, which then converts to product P and regenerates the free enzyme. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 7.1.1 The Michaelis–Menten Mechanism The basic kinetic model for enzyme catalysis was proposed by Victor Henri and refined by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. The enzyme E binds reversibly to its substrate S, forming an enzyme–substrate complex ES, which then converts irreversibly to product P and regenerates the free enzyme: \\[\\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{S} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{ES} \\xrightarrow{k_\\mathrm{cat}} \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{P}\\] This gives the rate equations: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{ES}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{ES}] - k_\\mathrm{cat}[\\mathrm{ES}] \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= k_\\mathrm{cat}[\\mathrm{ES}] \\end{align*}\\] The rate of product formation depends on \\([\\mathrm{ES}]\\), which is difficult to measure directly. We need to express it in terms of experimentally accessible quantities. 7.1.2 Deriving the Michaelis–Menten Equation Applying the SSA to the enzyme–substrate complex: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{ES}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}] - (k_{-1} + k_\\mathrm{cat})[\\mathrm{ES}] \\approx 0\\] Solving for \\([\\mathrm{ES}]\\): \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_\\mathrm{cat}}\\] This still contains \\([\\mathrm{E}]\\), the free enzyme concentration, which changes during the reaction. We replace it using the enzyme conservation condition — the total enzyme concentration \\([\\mathrm{E}]_0\\) is constant: \\[[\\mathrm{E}]_0 = [\\mathrm{E}] + [\\mathrm{ES}] \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad [\\mathrm{E}] = [\\mathrm{E}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ES}]\\] Substituting and solving (the algebra is straightforward but involves several steps): \\[[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_\\mathrm{M} + [\\mathrm{S}]}\\] where we have defined the Michaelis constant: \\[\\begin{equation} K_\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_\\mathrm{cat}}{k_1} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) has units of concentration and quantifies the affinity between enzyme and substrate. When \\(k_\\mathrm{cat} \\ll k_{-1}\\), the Michaelis constant reduces to \\(K_\\mathrm{M} \\approx k_{-1}/k_1\\), which is the dissociation constant of the ES complex — a low \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) then indicates strong binding (high affinity). In general, \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) also depends on how quickly ES converts to product, so its interpretation is slightly more nuanced, but the rule of thumb holds: a lower \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) means the enzyme binds its substrate more effectively. The rate of product formation is then: \\[\\begin{equation} v = k_\\mathrm{cat}[\\mathrm{ES}] = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{cat}[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_\\mathrm{M} + [\\mathrm{S}]} = \\frac{v_\\mathrm{max}[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_\\mathrm{M} + [\\mathrm{S}]} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(v_\\mathrm{max} = k_\\mathrm{cat}[\\mathrm{E}]_0\\) is the maximum velocity — the rate when every enzyme molecule is bound to substrate. This is the Michaelis–Menten equation. It has the same mathematical form as the SSA rate laws in Lecture 5 — a quantity in the numerator divided by a sum of two terms in the denominator — and the same saturation behaviour emerges from the same competition. 7.1.3 Limiting Cases Figure 7.2: The Michaelis–Menten curve: reaction velocity \\(v\\) as a function of substrate concentration \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\). At low \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) the rate increases linearly. At high \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) the rate saturates at \\(v_\\mathrm{max}\\). The substrate concentration at which \\(v = v_\\mathrm{max}/2\\) equals \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\). [Draft figure from lecture slides.] Low substrate (\\([\\mathrm{S}] \\ll K_\\mathrm{M}\\)): \\[v \\approx \\frac{v_\\mathrm{max}}{K_\\mathrm{M}}[\\mathrm{S}]\\] The rate is first order in \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\). Most enzyme molecules are free, so doubling the substrate concentration doubles the rate of binding and hence the rate of product formation. High substrate (\\([\\mathrm{S}] \\gg K_\\mathrm{M}\\)): \\[v \\approx v_\\mathrm{max}\\] The rate is zero order in \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) — the enzyme is saturated. Every enzyme molecule already has a substrate bound, so adding more substrate cannot increase the rate. This is the hallmark of saturation kinetics. At the crossover point where \\([\\mathrm{S}] = K_\\mathrm{M}\\), substituting into the Michaelis–Menten equation gives \\(v = v_\\mathrm{max}/2\\). This provides a convenient graphical method for estimating \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\): it is the substrate concentration at which the rate is half-maximal. 7.1.4 Determining Michaelis–Menten Parameters Non-linear regression. The most reliable method is to fit the Michaelis–Menten equation directly to a plot of \\(v\\) versus \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) using computational least-squares fitting. Lineweaver–Burk plot. Taking the reciprocal of both sides of Eqn. (7.2): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_\\mathrm{M}}{v_\\mathrm{max}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{S}]} + \\frac{1}{v_\\mathrm{max}} \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] A plot of \\(1/v\\) versus \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\) is linear, with slope \\(K_\\mathrm{M}/v_\\mathrm{max}\\) and \\(y\\)-intercept \\(1/v_\\mathrm{max}\\). While historically important, the Lineweaver–Burk transformation magnifies errors at low \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) (where \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\) is large), so modern practice favours non-linear regression when computational tools are available. Figure 7.3: Lineweaver–Burk (double-reciprocal) plot. A plot of \\(1/v\\) versus \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\) gives a straight line with \\(y\\)-intercept \\(1/v_\\mathrm{max}\\) and slope \\(K_\\mathrm{M}/v_\\mathrm{max}\\). The \\(x\\)-intercept equals \\(-1/K_\\mathrm{M}\\). Note that data at low \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) (high \\(1/[\\mathrm{S}]\\)) carry disproportionate influence on the fit. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 7.1.5 Catalytic Efficiency The catalytic constant \\(k_\\mathrm{cat}\\) (also called the turnover number) gives the maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time: \\[k_\\mathrm{cat} = \\frac{v_\\mathrm{max}}{[\\mathrm{E}]_0}\\] A more complete measure of efficiency combines binding and catalysis. The specificity constant \\(k_\\mathrm{cat}/K_\\mathrm{M}\\) is the effective second-order rate constant for the reaction of free enzyme with free substrate at low \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\): \\[v \\approx \\frac{k_\\mathrm{cat}}{K_\\mathrm{M}}[\\mathrm{E}]_0[\\mathrm{S}] \\qquad \\text{(when } [\\mathrm{S}] \\ll K_\\mathrm{M}\\text{)}\\] The upper limit of \\(k_\\mathrm{cat}/K_\\mathrm{M}\\) is set by the rate at which enzyme and substrate molecules encounter each other by diffusion — approximately \\(10^{8}\\)–\\(10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). Enzymes that approach this limit, such as catalase and carbonic anhydrase, are said to be diffusion-limited: every encounter leads to reaction. You should be able to: Derive the Michaelis–Menten equation by applying the SSA to the enzyme–substrate complex and using the enzyme conservation condition. Identify the limiting behaviour at low and high \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\), and explain the physical meaning of \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\), \\(v_\\mathrm{max}\\), and \\(k_\\mathrm{cat}\\). 7.2 The Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm Enzyme kinetics describes binding at molecular active sites in solution. A closely related problem arises in surface chemistry: how does a gas adsorb onto a solid surface? Consider a surface with a fixed number of equivalent adsorption sites. Gas molecules A can bind to (adsorb on) empty sites, and adsorbed molecules can desorb back into the gas phase: \\[\\mathrm{A(g)} + \\text{site} \\underset{k_\\mathrm{d}}{\\stackrel{k_\\mathrm{a}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{A(ads)}\\] We define the fractional surface coverage \\(\\theta\\) as the fraction of sites that are occupied (\\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1\\)). The rate of adsorption is proportional to both the gas-phase pressure \\(p\\) and the fraction of empty sites \\((1 - \\theta)\\). The rate of desorption is proportional to the fraction of occupied sites \\(\\theta\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Rate of adsorption} &amp;= k_\\mathrm{a}\\,p\\,(1 - \\theta) \\\\ \\text{Rate of desorption} &amp;= k_\\mathrm{d}\\,\\theta \\end{align*}\\] At equilibrium (or equivalently, applying the SSA to the surface coverage), these rates are equal: \\[k_\\mathrm{a}\\,p\\,(1 - \\theta) = k_\\mathrm{d}\\,\\theta\\] Expanding and rearranging: \\[k_\\mathrm{a}\\,p = \\theta(k_\\mathrm{d} + k_\\mathrm{a}\\,p)\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta = \\frac{K\\,p}{1 + K\\,p} \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K = k_\\mathrm{a}/k_\\mathrm{d}\\) is the Langmuir adsorption constant (the ratio of the adsorption and desorption rate constants, with units of inverse pressure). 7.2.1 Limiting Cases Low pressure (\\(K\\,p \\ll 1\\)): \\[\\theta \\approx K\\,p\\] The coverage increases linearly with pressure. Most sites are empty, so each additional gas molecule has many available sites to bind to. High pressure (\\(K\\,p \\gg 1\\)): \\[\\theta \\approx 1\\] The surface is saturated — virtually every site is occupied. Increasing the pressure further has no effect on the coverage, because there are no more sites available. At \\(p = 1/K\\), the coverage is \\(\\theta = 1/2\\). The Langmuir constant \\(K\\) thus plays the same role as \\(1/K_\\mathrm{M}\\) in enzyme kinetics: it characterises the binding strength, and its reciprocal is the “half-saturation” value. You should be able to: Derive the Langmuir adsorption isotherm \\(\\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)\\) by balancing the rates of adsorption and desorption, and describe the limiting behaviour at low and high pressure. 7.3 The Common Pattern: Saturation Kinetics The Michaelis–Menten equation and the Langmuir isotherm describe very different physical systems — enzymes in solution and gases on surfaces — yet they share the same mathematical form. This is not a coincidence. Both arise from the same underlying mechanism: reversible binding to a finite number of sites, followed by a process that competes with unbinding. Michaelis–Menten Langmuir Binding sites Enzyme active sites Surface adsorption sites Species that binds Substrate S Gas molecule A Key variable \\(v/v_\\mathrm{max} = [\\mathrm{S}]/(K_\\mathrm{M} + [\\mathrm{S}])\\) \\(\\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)\\) Saturation All enzyme bound (\\(v = v_\\mathrm{max}\\)) All sites occupied (\\(\\theta = 1\\)) Half-saturation \\([\\mathrm{S}] = K_\\mathrm{M}\\) \\(p = 1/K\\) Low-concentration limit First order in \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) \\(\\theta\\) proportional to \\(p\\) High-concentration limit Zero order in \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) \\(\\theta\\) independent of \\(p\\) The general pattern is: when the number of sites is limited and binding is reversible, the response (rate or coverage) increases with the concentration of the binding species but eventually saturates. This behaviour appears across chemistry and biology — from enzyme kinetics and surface catalysis to receptor–ligand binding and ion-channel gating. In surface reactions where two species compete for the same sites, this competition can lead to the counterintuitive phenomenon of negative reaction orders, where increasing a reactant’s concentration actually slows the reaction (Appendix C). 7.4 Key Concepts The Michaelis–Menten equation, \\(v = v_\\mathrm{max}[\\mathrm{S}]/(K_\\mathrm{M} + [\\mathrm{S}])\\), is derived by applying the SSA to the enzyme–substrate complex and using the enzyme conservation condition \\([\\mathrm{E}]_0 = [\\mathrm{E}] + [\\mathrm{ES}]\\). \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) is the substrate concentration at which the rate is half-maximal. It quantifies enzyme–substrate affinity: lower \\(K_\\mathrm{M}\\) means stronger binding. At low \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) the reaction is first order (most enzyme is free); at high \\([\\mathrm{S}]\\) it is zero order (enzyme is saturated). The Langmuir adsorption isotherm, \\(\\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)\\), describes the fractional coverage of a surface as a function of gas pressure. It is derived by balancing the rates of adsorption and desorption. Both equations share the same mathematical form because both describe reversible binding to a finite number of sites — the defining feature of saturation kinetics. The specificity constant \\(k_\\mathrm{cat}/K_\\mathrm{M}\\) measures the overall catalytic efficiency of an enzyme, with an upper limit set by the diffusion-controlled encounter rate. "],["chain-reactions.html", "Lecture 8 Chain Reactions 8.1 The H2 + Br2 Reaction 8.2 The Anatomy of a Chain Reaction 8.3 Key Concepts", " Lecture 8 Chain Reactions So far, the mechanisms we have studied — consecutive reactions, pre-equilibria, enzyme catalysis — all lead to steady, predictable kinetics. But not all reactions behave so tamely. In a chain reaction, reactive intermediates are not merely consumed — they are regenerated by the very steps that form the products, creating a self-sustaining cycle. Understanding chain reactions requires the same SSA tools we have developed, but the results can be far more dramatic. 8.1 The H2 + Br2 Reaction The gas-phase reaction of hydrogen with bromine to form hydrogen bromide: \\[\\mathrm{H_2} + \\mathrm{Br_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\] appears simple, but its experimentally determined rate law is anything but: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}]} \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law has two unusual features: a fractional order of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in Br2, and a term in the denominator that involves the product HBr. Neither feature can be explained by a single elementary step. To understand where this rate law comes from, we need to consider the full chain mechanism. 8.1.1 The Mechanism The reaction proceeds through a sequence of elementary steps involving two reactive intermediates — bromine radicals (\\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\)) and hydrogen radicals (\\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\)): Initiation: \\[\\mathrm{Br_2} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_1} 2\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Propagation: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2} &amp;\\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br_2} &amp;\\xrightarrow{k_3} \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\end{align*}\\] Inhibition (reverse of first propagation step): \\[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\xrightarrow{k_{-2}} \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2}\\] Termination: \\[2\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_4} \\mathrm{Br_2} + \\mathrm{M}\\] Figure 8.1: The cyclic nature of the H\\(_2\\) + Br\\(_2\\) chain reaction. Bromine radicals are consumed in one propagation step and regenerated in the next, creating a self-sustaining cycle that produces two molecules of HBr per turn. The inhibition step diverts H\\(^\\bullet\\) back to Br\\(^\\bullet\\) without forming product. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] Notice the cyclic structure of the propagation steps: \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\) is consumed in the first propagation step and regenerated in the second. Each complete cycle of propagation produces two molecules of HBr and regenerates the radical that started the cycle. This is the defining feature of a chain reaction — the intermediates catalyse their own regeneration. 8.1.2 Deriving the Rate Law Using the SSA We apply the SSA to both radical intermediates. The key simplification comes from a physical observation: the propagation steps are much faster than initiation and termination. This means that in the SSA equation for \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\), the propagation terms nearly cancel (each \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\) consumed in one propagation step is regenerated in the next). What remains is a balance between initiation and termination: \\[2k_1[\\mathrm{Br_2}][\\mathrm{M}] = 2k_4[\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]^2[\\mathrm{M}]\\] \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]_\\mathrm{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{k_4}}\\,[\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2} \\tag{8.2} \\end{equation}\\] This result immediately explains the \\([\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}\\) dependence in the experimental rate law: it comes from the square root in the steady-state radical concentration, which in turn arises because termination is second order in \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\) (two radicals must meet to recombine). Applying the SSA to \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\) and substituting \\([\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}]_\\mathrm{ss}\\), we can derive the full rate of HBr formation. The algebra is involved (and the details are not examinable), but the result is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{2k_2\\sqrt{k_1/k_4}\\,[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + (k_{-2}/k_3)[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}]} \\tag{8.3} \\end{equation}\\] This matches the experimental rate law (Eqn. (8.1)) exactly, with \\(k = 2k_2\\sqrt{k_1/k_4}\\) and \\(k&#39; = k_{-2}/k_3\\). 8.1.3 Physical Interpretation The derived rate law tells us two things about the mechanism: The \\([\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}\\) dependence arises because the steady-state radical concentration depends on the square root of the Br2 concentration (Eqn. (8.2)). This is a direct consequence of the bimolecular termination step. The inhibition by HBr appears in the denominator. The inhibition step (\\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2}\\)) competes with the forward propagation step (\\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Br_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr}\\)). Both consume \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\), but only the forward step produces HBr. The ratio \\([\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}]\\) in the denominator captures this competition: as product accumulates relative to reactant, inhibition becomes increasingly important and the reaction slows down. This is an example of a negative reaction order — a phenomenon explored further in Appendix C. You should be able to: Identify the initiation, propagation, termination, and inhibition steps in the H2 + Br2 mechanism, explain the physical origin of the \\([\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}\\) dependence and the inhibition term, and describe how the SSA is applied to derive the rate law. 8.2 The Anatomy of a Chain Reaction The H2 + Br2 reaction illustrates the general features shared by all chain reactions: Initiation — A step that creates reactive intermediates (usually radicals) from stable molecules. This is often slow and may require an external energy source (heat, light, or a chemical initiator). Propagation — A cyclic sequence of steps in which each step consumes one reactive intermediate and generates another. The cycle produces product molecules while regenerating the intermediates that sustain the chain. Termination — Steps that remove reactive intermediates from the cycle, usually by radical recombination. These steps compete with propagation and ultimately limit the chain length. Inhibition — Steps that consume intermediates unproductively (regenerating reactants rather than forming products). Not all chain reactions have inhibition steps, but when present they reduce the overall rate. Figure 8.2: The general anatomy of a chain reaction: initiation creates reactive intermediates (R\\(_1\\), R\\(_2\\)), propagation regenerates them in a cyclic sequence while producing products (P), and termination removes them. The competition between propagation and termination determines whether the chain is sustained. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 8.2.1 Straight Chains versus Branching Chains Chain reactions fall into two fundamentally different categories, depending on what happens to the number of reactive intermediates during propagation. In a straight chain reaction, each propagation step regenerates exactly one reactive intermediate for every one consumed. The H2 + Br2 reaction is an example: when \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\) reacts, it produces one \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\); when \\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\) reacts, it produces one \\(\\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet}\\). The total number of radicals is maintained by the propagation cycle and slowly depleted by termination. Straight chain reactions reach a steady state. In a branching chain reaction, one or more propagation steps produce more reactive intermediates than they consume. The combustion of hydrogen provides the classic example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{O_2} &amp;\\rightarrow \\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} \\\\ \\mathrm{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2} &amp;\\rightarrow \\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} \\\\ \\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2} &amp;\\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_2O} + \\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} \\end{align*}\\] In the first step, one radical (\\(\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet}\\)) generates two new radicals (\\(\\mathrm{OH}^{\\bullet}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}\\)). This means the radical population can grow with each cycle. If this branching outpaces termination, the radical concentration increases exponentially — and the reaction accelerates towards an explosion. Whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or runs away to explosion depends on the competition between branching (which multiplies intermediates) and termination (which removes them). In the next chapter, we develop this idea quantitatively using a general feedback model. You should be able to: Classify the steps in a chain reaction mechanism as initiation, propagation, termination, or inhibition, and distinguish between straight chain and branching chain reactions based on whether propagation steps conserve or multiply the number of reactive intermediates. 8.3 Key Concepts Chain reactions involve a cyclic propagation sequence in which reactive intermediates (usually radicals) are regenerated by the steps that produce the products. The H2 + Br2 rate law, \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}/(1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}])\\), is derived by applying the SSA to both radical intermediates. The \\([\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}\\) dependence arises from bimolecular termination; the HBr inhibition term arises from a reverse propagation step. Every chain reaction has initiation (creating intermediates), propagation (regenerating them while forming products), and termination (removing them). Some also have inhibition steps. In a straight chain, each propagation cycle conserves the number of intermediates. In a branching chain, propagation multiplies the number of intermediates, potentially leading to exponential growth and explosion. The competition between branching and termination determines whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or runs away — a question we analyse quantitatively in the next chapter. "],["feedback-stability-and-explosions.html", "Lecture 9 Feedback, Stability, and Explosions 9.1 The General Feedback Equation 9.2 Solving the Feedback Equation 9.3 From Mechanism to Stability 9.4 Key Concepts", " Lecture 9 Feedback, Stability, and Explosions In the previous chapter, we saw that chain reactions can be classified as straight or branching depending on whether propagation conserves or multiplies the number of reactive intermediates. We now ask the quantitative question: what determines whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or explodes? The answer lies in a simple differential equation whose behaviour is controlled by a single parameter — the feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\). 9.1 The General Feedback Equation Consider a reactive intermediate I that is produced by initiation and whose concentration changes through two competing effects: Initiation creates new intermediates at a constant rate \\(\\nu_f = k_\\mathrm{init}[\\mathrm{M}]\\), independent of \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\). Propagation and termination together cause \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) to grow or decay at a rate proportional to \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) itself. The rate equation for I is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}] \\tag{9.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\phi\\) is the feedback parameter that captures the net effect of all processes that depend on the intermediate concentration. The sign of \\(\\phi\\) determines everything. 9.1.1 What Determines \\(\\phi\\)? The feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\) reflects the competition between processes that create intermediates and processes that remove them: For a straight chain reaction (e.g. H2 + Br2), the propagation steps conserve the number of intermediates — every radical consumed produces exactly one new radical. The net effect on \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) comes only from termination, which removes intermediates: \\[\\phi = -k_\\mathrm{term}\\] Since \\(k_\\mathrm{term} &gt; 0\\), the feedback parameter is negative. Termination acts as a brake: the faster the intermediates build up, the faster they are removed by recombination. For a branching chain reaction (e.g. H2/O2 combustion), the propagation steps multiply intermediates. Each propagation cycle creates new radicals at a rate proportional to \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\), competing with termination: \\[\\phi = k_\\mathrm{branch} - k_\\mathrm{term}\\] Now the sign of \\(\\phi\\) depends on which process wins. If termination dominates (\\(k_\\mathrm{term} &gt; k_\\mathrm{branch}\\)), then \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\) and the system behaves like a straight chain — it reaches a steady state. If branching dominates (\\(k_\\mathrm{branch} &gt; k_\\mathrm{term}\\)), then \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\) and the intermediate concentration grows without bound. Figure 9.1: A branching chain reaction: each propagation step produces two intermediates from one, leading to exponential growth in the radical population. If branching outpaces termination (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)), the number of intermediates doubles with each cycle. [Draft figure from lecture slides.] 9.2 Solving the Feedback Equation Eqn. (9.1) is a first-order linear ODE that we can solve by separation of variables. With the initial condition \\([\\mathrm{I}]_0 = 0\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]} = \\mathrm{d}t\\] Integrating both sides: \\[\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]_t}{\\nu_f}\\right) = t\\] Rearranging: \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{I}]_t = \\frac{\\nu_f}{\\phi}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi t} - 1\\right) \\tag{9.2} \\end{equation}\\] This single equation describes both stable and explosive behaviour, depending entirely on the sign of \\(\\phi\\). 9.2.1 Negative Feedback (\\(\\phi &lt; 0\\)): Steady State When \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\), the exponential term \\(\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi t}\\) decays to zero as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). The intermediate concentration approaches a constant value: \\[[\\mathrm{I}]_\\infty = \\frac{\\nu_f}{|\\phi|}\\] This is a steady state: the rate of initiation is exactly balanced by the rate of termination. The system is self-regulating — if \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) rises above the steady-state value, the increased termination rate pulls it back down. This is the scenario that underpins the steady-state approximation we have used throughout the course. The time to reach the steady state is characterised by \\(\\tau = 1/|\\phi|\\). If \\(|\\phi|\\) is large (fast termination), the steady state is reached quickly and persists for most of the reaction — exactly the conditions under which the SSA is valid. 9.2.2 Positive Feedback (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)): Explosion When \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\), the exponential term \\(\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi t}\\) grows without bound. The intermediate concentration increases exponentially: \\[[\\mathrm{I}]_t \\approx \\frac{\\nu_f}{\\phi}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi t} \\qquad \\text{(for large } t\\text{)}\\] Branching creates intermediates faster than termination can remove them. Each new radical generates more than one replacement, leading to a cascade. The radical population — and hence the reaction rate — increases exponentially. This is a chain-branching explosion: the reaction accelerates catastrophically until limited by reactant depletion or physical containment. Figure 9.2: Solutions to the feedback equation for negative and positive feedback. When \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\), \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) rises to a steady state \\(\\nu_f/|\\phi|\\) (lower curve). When \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\), \\([\\mathrm{I}]\\) grows exponentially — the signature of a chain-branching explosion (upper curve). [Draft figure from lecture slides.] You should be able to: Write the general feedback equation \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]/\\mathrm{d}t = \\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]\\), explain the physical meaning of the feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\), and predict whether a chain reaction will reach a steady state (\\(\\phi &lt; 0\\)) or explode (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)) from the relative rates of branching and termination. 9.3 From Mechanism to Stability We can now connect the abstract feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\) to the elementary steps of a specific mechanism. Consider a general chain reaction with initiation, propagation, branching, and termination: Initiation: \\(\\mathrm{M} \\xrightarrow{k_\\mathrm{init}} \\mathrm{I}\\) (rate \\(= k_\\mathrm{init}[\\mathrm{M}] = \\nu_f\\)) Propagation (straight): \\(\\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_\\mathrm{prop}} \\mathrm{I} + \\text{products}\\) (no net change in [I]) Branching: \\(\\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_\\mathrm{branch}} 2\\mathrm{I} + \\text{products}\\) (net gain of one I) Termination: \\(\\mathrm{I} \\xrightarrow{k_\\mathrm{term}} \\text{inactive products}\\) (net loss of one I) The rate equation for I is: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\underbrace{\\nu_f}_{\\text{initiation}} + \\underbrace{k_\\mathrm{branch}[\\mathrm{A}]}_{\\text{branching}} \\cdot [\\mathrm{I}] - \\underbrace{k_\\mathrm{term}}_{\\text{termination}} \\cdot [\\mathrm{I}]\\] This has the form of Eqn. (9.1) with: \\[\\begin{equation} \\phi = k_\\mathrm{branch}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_\\mathrm{term} \\tag{9.3} \\end{equation}\\] This expression reveals why conditions matter: Concentration dependence. If the branching step involves a reactant A, then \\(\\phi\\) depends on \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\). A dilute mixture may have \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\) (safe), while a concentrated mixture has \\(\\phi &gt; 0\\) (explosive). This is why fuel–air mixtures explode only above a certain concentration. Pressure dependence. In gas-phase reactions, termination often occurs at surfaces (vessel walls), while branching occurs in the gas phase. Changing the pressure alters the balance: at low pressure, molecules reach the walls easily and \\(k_\\mathrm{term}\\) is large (safe); at intermediate pressures, gas-phase branching may dominate (explosive); at very high pressures, three-body termination in the gas phase becomes important and the system may become safe again. Temperature dependence. The rate constants \\(k_\\mathrm{branch}\\) and \\(k_\\mathrm{term}\\) have different activation energies. Raising the temperature may push \\(\\phi\\) from negative to positive, triggering an explosion. These considerations explain why hydrogen–oxygen mixtures have complex explosion limits — boundaries in pressure–temperature space that separate explosive from non-explosive conditions. The limits correspond to the condition \\(\\phi = 0\\), where branching and termination are exactly balanced. You should be able to: Given a chain reaction mechanism with initiation, branching, and termination steps, write the feedback equation for the reactive intermediate, identify the feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\), and predict the conditions (concentration, pressure, temperature) under which the reaction will reach a steady state or become explosive. 9.4 Key Concepts The feedback equation \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{I}]/\\mathrm{d}t = \\nu_f + \\phi[\\mathrm{I}]\\) describes the evolution of reactive intermediates in chain reactions. The initiation rate \\(\\nu_f\\) creates intermediates; the feedback parameter \\(\\phi\\) determines whether they accumulate or are controlled. For straight chains, \\(\\phi = -k_\\mathrm{term} &lt; 0\\): termination provides negative feedback and the system reaches a steady state. For branching chains, \\(\\phi = k_\\mathrm{branch}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_\\mathrm{term}\\): the sign depends on the competition between branching (which multiplies intermediates) and termination (which removes them). The general solution \\([\\mathrm{I}]_t = (\\nu_f/\\phi)(\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi t} - 1)\\) describes both steady-state behaviour (\\(\\phi &lt; 0\\)) and explosive runaway (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)) within a single equation. Explosion limits correspond to the condition \\(\\phi = 0\\). They depend on concentration, pressure, and temperature because these variables affect the rates of branching and termination differently. The SSA is valid precisely when \\(\\phi &lt; 0\\) and \\(|\\phi|\\) is large — the intermediate reaches its steady state quickly and stays there. Positive feedback (\\(\\phi &gt; 0\\)) represents the breakdown of the SSA.

But concentration is only half the story. Every chemist knows that reactions go faster when you heat them up. In this chapter, we put this observation on a quantitative footing with the Arrhenius equation, which connects the rate constant to temperature and reveals the energetic requirements for a reaction to proceed. 10.1 The Arrhenius Equation In the late 19th century, Svante Arrhenius observed that for many reactions, the rate constant \\(k\\) increases exponentially with temperature according to: \\[\\begin{equation} k = A\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT} \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(A\\) is the pre-exponential factor (same units as \\(k\\)) \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is the activation energy (\\(\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}\\)) \\(R\\) is the gas constant (\\(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\)) \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature (K) The exponential factor \\(\\mathrm{e}^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT}\\) represents the fraction of molecules with enough energy to react. As \\(T\\) increases, this fraction grows rapidly — explaining why even modest temperature increases can produce large rate enhancements. Figure 10.1: Rate constant \\(k\\) as a function of temperature. The exponential relationship means that \\(k\\) increases steeply with \\(T\\), with higher \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) giving a steeper temperature dependence. 10.2 The Linearised Arrhenius Equation Taking the natural logarithm of Eqn. (10.1): \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{T} \\tag{10.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is the equation of a straight line with \\(\\ln k\\) on the \\(y\\)-axis and \\(1/T\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis: Slope \\(= -E_\\mathrm{a}/R\\) \\(y\\)-intercept \\(= \\ln A\\) An Arrhenius plot of \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(1/T\\) is therefore the standard graphical method for determining activation energies. A steeper (more negative) slope indicates a larger activation energy — the reaction is more sensitive to temperature. Figure 10.2: Arrhenius plot: \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(1/T\\). The slope gives \\(-E_\\mathrm{a}/R\\) and the \\(y\\)-intercept gives \\(\\ln A\\). A steeper slope corresponds to a higher activation energy. The line of best fit is used to extract \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) and \\(A\\) from experimental data. 10.3 Physical Meaning of the Arrhenius Parameters 10.3.1 The Activation Energy (\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\)) The activation energy represents an energy threshold that must be exceeded for reactants to transform into products. We can visualise this using a reaction coordinate diagram: Figure 10.3: Reaction coordinate diagram showing the energy profile along the reaction pathway. The activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is the height of the energy barrier separating reactants from products. The transition state sits at the top of the barrier. The energy difference \\(\\Delta E_\\mathrm{r}\\) between reactants and products determines the thermodynamics; \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) determines the kinetics. At temperature \\(T\\), molecules have a distribution of kinetic energies. Only those with energy exceeding \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) can surmount the barrier and react. The Boltzmann factor \\(\\mathrm{e}^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT}\\) gives the fraction of molecules that meet this criterion. As \\(T\\) increases, the energy distribution broadens and a larger fraction of molecules can react — which is why the rate increases. 10.3.2 The Pre-Exponential Factor (\\(A\\)) The pre-exponential factor represents the rate constant that would be observed if the energy barrier were absent (\\(E_\\mathrm{a} = 0\\)). It encapsulates all the non-energetic factors that affect the reaction rate: The frequency of molecular collisions The probability that colliding molecules have the correct orientation Other geometric and steric factors For bimolecular reactions, \\(A\\) is typically in the range \\(10^{9}\\)–\\(10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{dm}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\), reflecting the collision frequency modified by steric requirements. 10.4 Determining Arrhenius Parameters 10.4.1 From an Arrhenius Plot The most common approach is to measure \\(k\\) at several temperatures, plot \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(1/T\\), and determine \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) from the slope and \\(A\\) from the intercept. In practice, the \\(y\\)-intercept (\\(\\ln A\\)) corresponds to \\(1/T = 0\\) (infinite temperature), which lies far outside the experimental data range. A more reliable method is to use the slope together with a point on the fitted line to calculate \\(A\\) without extrapolation. 10.4.2 The Two-Temperature Formula When rate constants are known at just two temperatures, the activation energy can be determined directly. Subtracting the Arrhenius equation at \\(T_1\\) from that at \\(T_2\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln\\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) \\tag{10.3} \\end{equation}\\] This is a very practical result: given \\(k\\) at two temperatures, we can find \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) without knowing \\(A\\). Rearranging: \\[E_\\mathrm{a} = \\frac{R\\ln(k_2/k_1)}{1/T_1 - 1/T_2}\\] The same equation can be used in reverse: given \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) and \\(k\\) at one temperature, we can predict \\(k\\) at another temperature. A rough rule of thumb for reactions with typical activation energies (\\(\\sim 50\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}\\)) is that the rate approximately doubles for every \\(10\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) increase in temperature near room temperature — though the exact factor depends on \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). You should be able to: Use the Arrhenius equation to construct an Arrhenius plot and extract \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) and \\(A\\), and apply the two-temperature formula (Eqn. (10.3)) to calculate \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) from rate constants at two temperatures or to predict a rate constant at a new temperature. 10.5 Negative Activation Energies and Non-Arrhenius Behaviour 10.5.1 Negative Activation Energies For most reactions, \\(E_\\mathrm{a} &gt; 0\\) and the rate increases with temperature. But some reactions display the opposite behaviour — their rates decrease as temperature rises, corresponding to a negative apparent activation energy. We have already met an example: the oxidation of nitric oxide (Lecture 7): \\[2\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] This reaction proceeds through a pre-equilibrium mechanism: \\[\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{NO} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} (\\mathrm{NO})_2 \\qquad (\\mathrm{NO})_2 + \\mathrm{O_2} \\xrightarrow{k_2} 2\\mathrm{NO_2}\\] The observed rate constant is \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K = k_2 k_1/k_{-1}\\). The dimerisation equilibrium is exothermic, so \\(K\\) decreases with increasing temperature (Le Chatelier’s principle). Although \\(k_2\\) increases with temperature (it has a positive activation energy), the decrease in \\(K\\) is faster — so the overall effect is that \\(k_\\mathrm{obs}\\) decreases. The Arrhenius plot has a positive slope, corresponding to a negative apparent \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). A negative activation energy does not mean there is no energy barrier for the individual elementary steps — each step has a positive \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). Rather, the observed \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) for the overall reaction is a combination of the activation energies for the individual steps and the enthalpy change of the pre-equilibrium step. Figure 10.4: Arrhenius plot for a reaction with negative apparent activation energy (positive slope), such as the oxidation of NO. The rate decreases with increasing temperature because the exothermic pre-equilibrium shifts to the left faster than the slow step accelerates. You should be able to: Explain why the NO oxidation reaction has a negative apparent activation energy by connecting the temperature dependence of the pre-equilibrium constant to the overall rate. 10.5.2 Non-Arrhenius Behaviour Several situations can produce curved Arrhenius plots — departures from the simple linear relationship between \\(\\ln k\\) and \\(1/T\\): Competing reaction pathways. When two parallel pathways with different activation energies contribute to the overall rate, the observed rate constant is \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1 + k_2\\). At low temperatures, the low-\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) pathway dominates; at high temperatures, the high-\\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) pathway takes over. The Arrhenius plot shows two approximately linear regions with different slopes, connected by a curve. Change in rate-determining step. For multi-step mechanisms, the rate-determining step can change with temperature if different steps have different activation energies. Diffusion-limited reactions. When the reaction rate approaches the diffusion limit, the temperature dependence weakens because diffusion has a lower activation energy than most chemical steps. Figure 10.5: Non-Arrhenius behaviour: a non-linear Arrhenius plot arising from two competing reaction pathways with different activation energies. The observed rate constant \\(k_\\mathrm{obs} = k_1 + k_2\\) shows two approximately linear regimes connected by a curve, as the dominant pathway changes with temperature. You should be able to: Describe how competing reaction pathways with different activation energies can produce a curved Arrhenius plot. 10.6 Key Concepts The Arrhenius equation, \\(k = A\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT}\\), describes how rate constants increase exponentially with temperature. It contains two parameters: the activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) (the energy barrier) and the pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) (the collision frequency and orientation probability). An Arrhenius plot of \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(1/T\\) gives a straight line with slope \\(-E_\\mathrm{a}/R\\) and intercept \\(\\ln A\\). The two-temperature formula, \\(\\ln(k_2/k_1) = (E_\\mathrm{a}/R)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)\\), allows determination of \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) from measurements at two temperatures or prediction of \\(k\\) at a new temperature. Negative apparent activation energies arise in multi-step mechanisms where a pre-equilibrium step is exothermic — the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature faster than the rate constant of the slow step increases. Non-Arrhenius behaviour (curved Arrhenius plots) can arise from competing pathways, changes in the rate-determining step, or diffusion limitations. The Arrhenius equation provides the bridge between macroscopic kinetic measurements (rate constants at different temperatures) and molecular-level understanding (energy barriers and collision dynamics). "],["appendix-two-reactants.html", "A Integrated Rate Law for Two Different Reactants A.1 Setting Up the Problem A.2 Solving by Partial Fractions A.3 The Equal-Concentration Limit", " A Integrated Rate Law for Two Different Reactants In Lecture 2, we stated without proof the integrated rate law for a reaction between two different species, \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\text{products}\\), with rate law \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\). Here we derive that result. A.1 Setting Up the Problem Both concentrations change with time, so the differential rate law \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\] contains two unknowns. To integrate, we need to express \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) in terms of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\). For 1:1 stoichiometry, mass balance (Lecture 1) tells us that A and B are consumed in equal amounts, so at any time \\(t\\): \\[[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\] Rearranging gives \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 + [\\mathrm{A}]_t\\). Writing \\(\\Delta = [\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\) for the difference in initial concentrations, the differential equation becomes: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]([\\mathrm{A}] + \\Delta)} = -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\] A.2 Solving by Partial Fractions The left-hand side can be decomposed using partial fractions: \\[\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]([\\mathrm{A}] + \\Delta)} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]} - \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}] + \\Delta}\\right)\\] Integrating both sides between \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\left[\\ln[\\mathrm{A}] - \\ln([\\mathrm{A}] + \\Delta)\\right]_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} &amp;= -kt \\\\[6pt] \\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\left(\\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_t}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} - \\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_t}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0}\\right) &amp;= -kt \\end{align*}\\] where in the second line we have used \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t + \\Delta = [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\) and \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 + \\Delta = [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\). Rearranging gives the final result: \\[\\begin{equation} kt = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_t / [\\mathrm{B}]_0}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t / [\\mathrm{A}]_0}\\right) \\tag{A.1} \\end{equation}\\] A.3 The Equal-Concentration Limit This result requires \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 \\neq [\\mathrm{B}]_0\\) (i.e. \\(\\Delta \\neq 0\\)); otherwise the partial fraction decomposition breaks down (we cannot divide by zero). If the initial concentrations are equal, then by mass balance \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\) at all times, so the rate law becomes \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]/\\mathrm{d}t = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\). This is exactly the single-reactant second-order case already solved in Lecture 2 (Eqn. (2.4)). "],["appendix-third-body.html", "B Why Don’t All Bimolecular Reactions Require a Third Body? B.1 The Problem: Energy Disposal After Bond Formation B.2 Why Most Reactions Avoid This Problem B.3 A Spectrum of Behaviour", " B Why Don’t All Bimolecular Reactions Require a Third Body? In Lecture 7, we saw that ozone formation requires a third body to carry away the excess energy released when a new O–O bond forms (Section 6.2). The argument rested on energy and momentum conservation — principles that apply to all molecular collisions. This raises a natural question: if these constraints prevent a simple O + O2 reaction, why do we routinely observe second-order kinetics for other bimolecular reactions? This appendix explores the physical factors that determine whether a reaction can proceed without third-body assistance. The material is not examinable, but it deepens our understanding of why different reactions exhibit different kinetic behaviour. B.1 The Problem: Energy Disposal After Bond Formation When two species collide and form a new bond, the bond energy is released as kinetic energy of the product molecule. Conservation of momentum constrains how this energy is distributed: much of it ends up as vibration along the newly formed bond. If this vibrational energy exceeds the bond dissociation energy, the product flies apart again before it can be observed — the reaction effectively has not occurred. For ozone, the situation is extreme. Formation of the O–O bond releases approximately \\(107\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}\\), and ozone — a triatomic molecule — has only three vibrational modes to absorb this energy. The newly formed bond is so vibrationally excited that dissociation is inevitable without a third body to carry away the excess. B.2 Why Most Reactions Avoid This Problem Several factors, often acting in combination, allow most bimolecular reactions to manage the released energy without requiring third-body intervention. Activation barriers redirect energy flow. Most reactions have an activation energy barrier, creating a transition state that the system must pass through. The descent from this saddle point on the potential energy surface distributes energy across multiple degrees of freedom — vibrational, rotational, and translational — rather than concentrating it in a single bond. Ozone formation is barrierless, so this redistribution mechanism is absent. Larger molecules have more vibrational modes. A non-linear molecule with \\(N\\) atoms has \\(3N - 6\\) vibrational modes. For ozone (\\(N = 3\\)), this gives only 3 modes; for a molecule with 10 atoms, it gives 24. The same amount of released energy spreads across many more modes, reducing the excitation in any single bond below the dissociation threshold. Exchange reactions balance energy flow. Many bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous bond breaking and bond formation: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{BC} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AB} + \\mathrm{C}\\] The energy required to break the B–C bond partially offsets the energy released by forming the A–B bond. This reduces the net energy that the products must accommodate. Ozone formation, by contrast, is a pure association reaction with no offsetting bond breaking. B.3 A Spectrum of Behaviour Rather than a sharp divide, reactions span a spectrum. The likelihood of requiring third-body stabilisation increases with: Decreasing activation barrier height Increasing reaction exothermicity Decreasing molecular complexity (fewer vibrational modes) Pure association character (no bond breaking to offset energy release) Ozone formation sits at the extreme end of this spectrum — highly exothermic, barrierless, forming a small molecule with few internal degrees of freedom. Most bimolecular reactions we encounter in this course have some combination of activation barriers, moderate energy release, and greater molecular complexity that allows them to proceed as straightforward second-order processes. This explains an observation from Lecture 1: termolecular processes are rare, and apparent third-order kinetics usually arise from sequential bimolecular steps (as in the NO oxidation mechanism discussed in Lecture 7) rather than genuine three-body collisions. "],["appendix-negative-orders.html", "C Negative Reaction Orders C.1 What Does a Negative Order Mean? C.2 Example 1: Product Inhibition in H2 + Br2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2HBr C.3 Example 2: Competitive Adsorption in Surface Reactions C.4 Recognising Negative Orders", " C Negative Reaction Orders In Lecture 1, we defined the order of a reaction with respect to a given species as the exponent in the rate law. For the reactions we encounter in the main lectures, these exponents are positive integers or zero: increasing a reactant’s concentration either speeds up the reaction or has no effect. In some reactions, however, increasing the concentration of a particular species slows down the reaction. This unusual behaviour corresponds to a negative reaction order. This appendix explores how negative orders arise from underlying mechanisms. The material is not examinable, but it illustrates an important theme of the course: macroscopic rate laws encode information about microscopic mechanisms. C.1 What Does a Negative Order Mean? When a species X appears with a negative order \\(n\\) in a rate law: \\[\\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{A}]^a[\\mathrm{B}]^b}{[\\mathrm{X}]^n}\\] increasing \\([\\mathrm{X}]\\) decreases the reaction rate. The species X effectively acts as an inhibitor rather than a promoter of the reaction. Negative orders cannot arise from a single elementary step — they always signal a complex, multi-step mechanism in which the species interferes with one or more productive reaction pathways. C.2 Example 1: Product Inhibition in H2 + Br2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2HBr The formation of hydrogen bromide — a chain reaction discussed in detail in Lecture 9 — provides a classic example of product inhibition. The empirical rate law is: \\[\\nu = \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}]}\\] At high concentrations of HBr (specifically when \\(k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br_2}] \\gg 1\\)), this simplifies to: \\[\\nu \\approx \\frac{k[\\mathrm{H_2}][\\mathrm{Br_2}]^{3/2}}{k&#39;[\\mathrm{HBr}]}\\] Here, HBr has an effective order of \\(-1\\). The very product we are trying to make inhibits its own formation. The origin lies in the chain mechanism. The key propagation steps produce HBr via reactive H\\(^{\\bullet}\\) radicals (Lecture 9), but HBr can also react with these same radicals: \\[\\mathrm{H}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{H_2}\\] This chain inhibition step consumes the very intermediates needed for product formation. The more HBr present, the more this reverse reaction competes with productive chain propagation, slowing the net rate. This is a general principle in chain kinetics: anything that consumes or deactivates chain-carrying intermediates produces negative kinetic behaviour. C.3 Example 2: Competitive Adsorption in Surface Reactions Surface-catalysed reactions provide another important class of systems with negative orders, closely related to the Langmuir adsorption model discussed in Lecture 8. Unlike homogeneous reactions, surface processes require that reactants first adsorb onto the catalyst before they can react. The catalyst surface has a limited number of active sites, creating the potential for competition. For a typical surface reaction following the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism: \\(\\mathrm{A}_{(\\mathrm{g})} + {*} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}{*}\\) (A adsorbs on an empty site \\({*}\\)) \\(\\mathrm{B}_{(\\mathrm{g})} + {*} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B}{*}\\) (B adsorbs on an empty site \\({*}\\)) \\(\\mathrm{A}{*} + \\mathrm{B}{*} \\rightarrow \\text{products} + 2{*}\\) (reaction between adsorbed species) The rate depends on having both A and B adsorbed on adjacent sites. If one species (say B) adsorbs much more strongly, or is present at very high pressure, it can monopolise the surface sites. Increasing the pressure of B then actually decreases the reaction rate, because B blocks the sites that A needs. This leads to a negative apparent order in B at high pressures, despite B being an essential reactant. This site-blocking effect is commonly observed in industrial catalysis. For example, in CO oxidation on platinum, excess CO can poison the catalyst by blocking oxygen adsorption sites. The mathematical framework from Lecture 8 — where the Langmuir isotherm describes surface coverage as a function of pressure — provides the quantitative basis for understanding these effects. C.4 Recognising Negative Orders Negative orders often appear in disguised forms within rate expressions: Denominator terms: Any concentration appearing in the denominator has a negative effective order, whether directly (e.g., \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]/[\\mathrm{X}]\\)) or within inhibition factors (e.g., \\(k[\\mathrm{A}]/(1 + K[\\mathrm{X}])\\)). Saturation behaviour: Rates that plateau or decrease with increasing concentration suggest competitive effects leading to negative orders in the high-concentration limit. The common thread is that negative orders arise when a species participates in the overall mechanism in ways that hinder rather than help the net forward reaction — whether by consuming reactive intermediates, blocking active sites, or driving reverse reactions.
