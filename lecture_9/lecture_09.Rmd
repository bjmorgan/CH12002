# Chain Reactions

So far, the mechanisms we have studied — consecutive reactions, pre-equilibria, enzyme catalysis — all lead to steady, predictable kinetics. But not all reactions behave so tamely. In a **chain reaction**, reactive intermediates are not merely consumed — they are *regenerated* by the very steps that form the products, creating a self-sustaining cycle. Understanding chain reactions requires the same SSA tools we have developed, but the results can be far more dramatic.

## The H~2~ + Br~2~ Reaction {#sec:hbr}

The gas-phase reaction of hydrogen with bromine to form hydrogen bromide:

$$\mathrm{H_2} + \mathrm{Br_2} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{HBr}$$

appears simple, but its experimentally determined rate law is anything but:

\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{k[\mathrm{H_2}][\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + k'[\mathrm{HBr}]/[\mathrm{Br_2}]}
(\#eq:hbr-experimental)
\end{equation}

This rate law has two unusual features: a fractional order of $\frac{1}{2}$ in Br~2~, and a term in the denominator that involves the *product* HBr. Neither feature can be explained by a single elementary step. To understand where this rate law comes from, we need to consider the full chain mechanism.

### The Mechanism

The reaction proceeds through a sequence of elementary steps involving two reactive intermediates — bromine radicals ($\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$) and hydrogen radicals ($\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$):

**Initiation:**
$$\mathrm{Br_2} + \mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_1} 2\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{M}$$

**Propagation:**
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{H_2} &\xrightarrow{k_2} \mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{HBr} \\
\mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{Br_2} &\xrightarrow{k_3} \mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{HBr}
\end{align*}

**Inhibition (reverse of first propagation step):**
$$\mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{HBr} \xrightarrow{k_{-2}} \mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{H_2}$$

**Termination:**
$$2\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_4} \mathrm{Br_2} + \mathrm{M}$$

```{r hbr-chain-cycle, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The cyclic nature of the H$_2$ + Br$_2$ chain reaction.

```

Notice the **cyclic** structure of the propagation steps: $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$ is consumed in the first propagation step and regenerated in the second. Each complete cycle of propagation produces two molecules of HBr and regenerates the radical that started the cycle. This is the defining feature of a chain reaction — the intermediates catalyse their own regeneration.

### Deriving the Rate Law Using the SSA

We apply the SSA to both radical intermediates. The key simplification comes from a physical observation: the propagation steps are much faster than initiation and termination. This means that in the SSA equation for $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$, the propagation terms nearly cancel (each $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$ consumed in one propagation step is regenerated in the next). What remains is a balance between initiation and termination:

$$2k_1[\mathrm{Br_2}][\mathrm{M}] = 2k_4[\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}]^2[\mathrm{M}]$$

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}]_\mathrm{ss} = \sqrt{\frac{k_1}{k_4}}\,[\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}
(\#eq:br-steady-state)
\end{equation}

This result immediately explains the $[\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}$ dependence in the experimental rate law: it comes from the square root in the steady-state radical concentration, which in turn arises because termination is *second order* in $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$ (two radicals must meet to recombine).

Applying the SSA to $\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$ and substituting $[\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}]_\mathrm{ss}$, we can derive the full rate of HBr formation. The algebra is involved (and the details are not examinable), but the result is:

\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{2k_2\sqrt{k_1/k_4}\,[\mathrm{H_2}][\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}}{1 + (k_{-2}/k_3)[\mathrm{HBr}]/[\mathrm{Br_2}]}
(\#eq:hbr-derived)
\end{equation}

This matches the experimental rate law (Eqn. \@ref(eq:hbr-experimental)) exactly, with $k = 2k_2\sqrt{k_1/k_4}$ and $k' = k_{-2}/k_3$.

### Physical Interpretation

The derived rate law tells us two things about the mechanism:

1. **The $[\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}$ dependence** arises because the steady-state radical concentration depends on the square root of the Br~2~ concentration (Eqn. \@ref(eq:br-steady-state)). This is a direct consequence of the bimolecular termination step.

2. **The inhibition by HBr** appears in the denominator. The inhibition step ($\mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{HBr} \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{H_2}$) competes with the forward propagation step ($\mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{Br_2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{HBr}$). Both consume $\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$, but only the forward step produces HBr. The ratio $[\mathrm{HBr}]/[\mathrm{Br_2}]$ in the denominator captures this competition: as product accumulates relative to reactant, inhibition becomes increasingly important and the reaction slows down. This is an example of a *negative reaction order* — a phenomenon explored further in Appendix \@ref(appendix-negative-orders).

## The Anatomy of a Chain Reaction {#sec:chain-anatomy}

The H~2~ + Br~2~ reaction illustrates the general features shared by all chain reactions:

**Initiation** — A step that creates reactive intermediates (usually radicals) from stable molecules. This is often slow and may require an external energy source (heat, light, or a chemical initiator).

**Propagation** — A cyclic sequence of steps in which each step consumes one reactive intermediate and generates another. The cycle produces product molecules while regenerating the intermediates that sustain the chain.

**Termination** — Steps that remove reactive intermediates from the cycle, usually by radical recombination. These steps compete with propagation and ultimately limit the chain length.

**Inhibition** — Steps that consume intermediates unproductively (regenerating reactants rather than forming products). Not all chain reactions have inhibition steps, but when present they reduce the overall rate.

```{r chain-anatomy, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The general anatomy of a chain reaction: initiation creates reactive intermediates (R$_1$, R$_2$), propagation regenerates them in a cyclic sequence while producing products (P), and termination removes them.

```

### Straight Chains versus Branching Chains

Chain reactions fall into two fundamentally different categories, depending on what happens to the number of reactive intermediates during propagation.

In a **straight chain** reaction, each propagation step regenerates exactly one reactive intermediate for every one consumed. The H~2~ + Br~2~ reaction is an example: when $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$ reacts, it produces one $\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$; when $\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$ reacts, it produces one $\mathrm{Br}^{\bullet}$. The total number of radicals is maintained by the propagation cycle and slowly depleted by termination. Straight chain reactions reach a steady state.

In a **branching chain** reaction, one or more propagation steps produce *more* reactive intermediates than they consume. The combustion of hydrogen provides the classic example:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{H}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{O_2} &\rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{O}^{\bullet\bullet} \\
\mathrm{O}^{\bullet\bullet} + \mathrm{H_2} &\rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{H}^{\bullet} \\
\mathrm{OH}^{\bullet} + \mathrm{H_2} &\rightarrow \mathrm{H_2O} + \mathrm{H}^{\bullet}
\end{align*}

In the first step, one radical ($\mathrm{H}^{\bullet}$) generates *two* new radicals ($\mathrm{OH}^{\bullet}$ and $\mathrm{O}^{\bullet\bullet}$). This means the radical population can grow with each cycle. If this branching outpaces termination, the radical concentration increases exponentially — and the reaction accelerates towards an **explosion**.

Whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or runs away to explosion depends on the competition between branching (which multiplies intermediates) and termination (which removes them). In the next chapter, we develop this idea quantitatively using a general feedback model.

## Key Concepts

- **Chain reactions** involve a cyclic propagation sequence in which reactive intermediates (usually radicals) are regenerated by the steps that produce the products.
- The H~2~ + Br~2~ rate law, $\nu = k[\mathrm{H_2}][\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}/(1 + k'[\mathrm{HBr}]/[\mathrm{Br_2}])$, is derived by applying the SSA to both radical intermediates. The $[\mathrm{Br_2}]^{1/2}$ dependence arises from bimolecular termination; the HBr inhibition term arises from a reverse propagation step.
- Every chain reaction has **initiation** (creating intermediates), **propagation** (regenerating them while forming products), and **termination** (removing them). Some also have **inhibition** steps.
- In a **straight chain**, each propagation cycle conserves the number of intermediates. In a **branching chain**, propagation *multiplies* the number of intermediates, potentially leading to exponential growth and explosion.
- The competition between branching and termination determines whether a chain reaction reaches a steady state or runs away — a question we analyse quantitatively in the next chapter.
