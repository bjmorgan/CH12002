# Unimolecular Reactions and Collision Dynamics

In the preceding chapters, we developed the steady-state approximation as a general tool for deriving rate laws from complex mechanisms. We now put it to work on real chemical problems. In this chapter, we tackle two puzzles that cannot be resolved without thinking carefully about elementary steps: how can a unimolecular reaction show pressure-dependent kinetics, and why do some apparently simple reactions require a third body to proceed?

## The Lindemann–Hinshelwood Mechanism {#sec:lindemann}

Many reactions that appear simple at first glance actually proceed through complex mechanisms involving multiple elementary steps. A classic example is the thermal decomposition of azomethane:

$$\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3} \rightarrow \mathrm{C_2H_6} + \mathrm{N_2}$$

At high pressures, this reaction exhibits first-order kinetics:

$$-\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = k[\mathrm{CH_3N_2CH_3}]$$

This simple rate law presents us with a fundamental mechanistic puzzle. We observe two seemingly contradictory behaviours:

1. The reaction shows first-order kinetics ($\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]$), suggesting each molecule reacts independently.

2. The rate increases with temperature, indicating that energy is required to overcome an activation barrier. But how does each molecule acquire this activation energy?

If the activation energy came from molecular collisions (the usual mechanism for thermal activation), we would expect the rate to depend on the frequency of these collisions. Since collision frequency is proportional to the concentration of both colliding species, this would lead to second-order kinetics ($\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^2$). Yet we observe first-order behaviour. Something more subtle must be going on.

### The Mechanism

In 1921, Frederick Lindemann proposed a three-step mechanism to resolve this paradox:

**Step 1 — Excitation by collision:**
$$\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_1} \mathrm{A^*} + \mathrm{M}$$

**Step 2 — Deactivation by collision:**
$$\mathrm{A^*} + \mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_{-1}} \mathrm{A} + \mathrm{M}$$

**Step 3 — Unimolecular decomposition:**
$$\mathrm{A^*} \xrightarrow{k_2} \mathrm{P}$$

Here, M represents any collision partner (often the reactant molecule itself), and A* represents an energetically excited molecule that has acquired enough energy to react. The key insight is that activation (Step 1) and reaction (Step 3) are *separate* events. A molecule can be activated by one collision, then react at a later time — or it may lose its energy in another collision (Step 2) before it has a chance to react.

```{r lindemann-steps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Lindemann mechanism: (1) A is excited by collision with M; (2) A* can be deactivated by a further collision; (3) A* decomposes unimolecularly to products. The SSA is applied to the reactive intermediate A*. [Draft figure from lecture slides.]", out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}

```

### Applying the Steady-State Approximation

The excited molecule A* is a reactive intermediate — it is formed by Step 1 and consumed by Steps 2 and 3. Applying the SSA:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A^*}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\mathrm{A^*}][\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\mathrm{A^*}] \approx 0$$

Solving for $[\mathrm{A^*}]$:

$$[\mathrm{A^*}]_\mathrm{ss} = \frac{k_1[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] + k_2}$$

The overall rate of product formation is then:

\begin{equation}
\nu = k_2[\mathrm{A^*}]_\mathrm{ss} = \frac{k_1 k_2[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] + k_2}
(\#eq:lindemann-rate)
\end{equation}

This is the **Lindemann rate law**. Notice that it has exactly the same mathematical structure as the SSA rate laws we derived in Lecture 5 (Eqn. \@ref(eq:ssa-rate-law)) — a ratio with competing terms in the denominator. The behaviour depends on which term dominates.

For the specific case of azomethane decomposition, where the reactant itself acts as the collision partner (M = A):

$$\nu = \frac{k_1 k_2[\mathrm{A}]^2}{k_{-1}[\mathrm{A}] + k_2}$$

### Pressure Dependence

The denominator of Eqn. \@ref(eq:lindemann-rate) contains $[\mathrm{M}]$, which is proportional to pressure. This gives the Lindemann mechanism a distinctive pressure dependence — the *apparent* reaction order changes with pressure.

**High-pressure limit ($k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] \gg k_2$):**

At high pressures, collisions are frequent and deactivation is much faster than decomposition. The denominator is dominated by $k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}]$:

\begin{equation}
\nu \approx \frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\mathrm{A}]
(\#eq:lindemann-high-p)
\end{equation}

The reaction is **first order** in A, with an effective rate constant $k_\mathrm{eff} = k_1 k_2/k_{-1}$. This explains the observed first-order kinetics at high pressures. Physically: excited molecules are produced and deactivated many times before any one of them happens to decompose. The rate-determining step is the unimolecular decomposition of A*, and the concentration of A* is maintained at its equilibrium value by the fast excitation–deactivation equilibrium.

**Low-pressure limit ($k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] \ll k_2$):**

At low pressures, collisions are rare. Once a molecule is excited, it decomposes before it encounters another molecule that could deactivate it. The denominator is dominated by $k_2$:

\begin{equation}
\nu \approx k_1[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}]
(\#eq:lindemann-low-p)
\end{equation}

The reaction is **second order** — first order in A and first order in M. The rate-determining step is now the excitation collision (Step 1), because every excited molecule goes on to react. This prediction was experimentally verified in 1927, providing strong support for the Lindemann mechanism.

The Lindemann mechanism thus resolves the unimolecular paradox: the reaction *is* activated by collisions, but at high pressures the excitation–deactivation equilibrium is so fast that it is invisible to the experimenter. The observed kinetics reflect only the slow unimolecular decomposition step.

```{r lindemann-pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Lindemann rate law at high pressure: when collisional deactivation is much faster than unimolecular reaction ($k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\gg k_2$), the reaction is first order with effective rate constant $k_1 k_2/k_{-1}$.

**You should be able to:** Apply the SSA to the Lindemann mechanism to derive the rate law $\nu = k_1 k_2[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}]/(k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] + k_2)$, and predict the reaction order at high and low pressures by identifying which term dominates in the denominator.

## Third-Order Reactions and Collision Dynamics {#sec:third-order}

### The NO Oxidation Puzzle

Some reactions exhibit third-order kinetics, such as the oxidation of nitric oxide:

$$2\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O_2} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{NO_2}$$

with rate law:

$$\nu = k[\mathrm{NO}]^2[\mathrm{O_2}]$$

A termolecular collision mechanism — in which two NO molecules and one O~2~ molecule must collide simultaneously — seems implausible. Simultaneous three-body collisions are extremely rare events. Moreover, this reaction has the unusual property that its rate *decreases* with increasing temperature, suggesting a more complex mechanism.

A pre-equilibrium mechanism provides a much better explanation:

$$\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{NO} \underset{k_{-1}}{\stackrel{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}} (\mathrm{NO})_2$$
$$(\mathrm{NO})_2 + \mathrm{O_2} \xrightarrow{k_2} 2\mathrm{NO_2}$$

At equilibrium:

$$K = \frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \frac{[(\mathrm{NO})_2]}{[\mathrm{NO}]^2}$$

The overall rate is:

\begin{equation}
\nu = k_2[(\mathrm{NO})_2][\mathrm{O_2}] = k_2 K[\mathrm{NO}]^2[\mathrm{O_2}]
(\#eq:no-oxidation-rate)
\end{equation}

This mechanism explains two key observations. First, the third-order kinetics: the rate depends on $[\mathrm{NO}]^2$ (from the equilibrium expression) and $[\mathrm{O_2}]$ (from the slow step), giving overall third-order behaviour without requiring a termolecular collision. Second, the negative temperature dependence: the dimerisation equilibrium in the first step is exothermic, so increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (Le Chatelier's principle), reducing $[(\mathrm{NO})_2]$ and hence slowing the overall reaction. The effective rate constant $k_\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K$ decreases with temperature because $K$ decreases faster than $k_2$ increases.

### Formation of Ozone: Why a Third Body is Needed

Another important third-order reaction is ozone formation:

$$\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O_2} + \mathrm{M} \rightarrow \mathrm{O_3} + \mathrm{M}$$

with rate law:

\begin{equation}
\nu = k[\mathrm{O}][\mathrm{O_2}][\mathrm{M}]
(\#eq:ozone-rate)
\end{equation}

where M represents a third body — any molecule present in the gas (typically N~2~ or O~2~). Why is a third body needed for this apparently simple combination reaction?

The requirement arises from two fundamental constraints of molecular collisions:

**Energy conservation.** The formation of ozone is highly exothermic, releasing approximately $107\,\mathrm{kJ\,mol}^{-1}$ when the new O–O bond forms. A bimolecular collision between O and O~2~ produces a vibrationally excited ozone molecule, O~3~*, that contains all this excess energy in its vibrational modes.

**Momentum conservation.** When O collides with O~2~, the total momentum of the system must be conserved. This constrains how the released energy is distributed: much of it ends up as internal vibrational energy of the O~3~* product rather than translational kinetic energy. The resulting O~3~* is so highly excited that it rapidly dissociates back to O + O~2~ — unless something removes the excess energy first.

```{r ozone-collision, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A bimolecular collision between O and O$_2$ produces a vibrationally excited O$_3^*$. Conservation of momentum and energy means the excess energy ends up as internal vibration, causing O$_3^*$ to dissociate unless a third body M removes the energy. [Draft figure from lecture slides.]", out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_7/figures/ozone_collision.png")
```

This is where the third body becomes essential. When the vibrationally excited O~3~* collides with M, the excess energy can be transferred to M as translational kinetic energy, allowing the ozone molecule to stabilise:

**Step 1 — Formation of excited ozone:**
$$\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O_2} \underset{k_{-1}}{\stackrel{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{O_3^*}$$

**Step 2 — Collisional stabilisation:**
$$\mathrm{O_3^*} + \mathrm{M} \xrightarrow{k_2} \mathrm{O_3} + \mathrm{M}$$

Applying a pre-equilibrium approximation to O~3~* yields the observed third-order rate law (Eqn. \@ref(eq:ozone-rate)), with $k_\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K = k_1 k_2/k_{-1}$.

The necessity for a third body illustrates a general principle: highly exothermic reactions involving small molecules (with few internal degrees of freedom to absorb the energy) often cannot proceed as simple bimolecular encounters. A third-body collision provides the mechanism to remove excess energy, allowing the product to survive. This explains why third-order kinetics are common in atmospheric chemistry and combustion, where small radicals and atoms frequently combine. Appendix \@ref(appendix-third-body) explores why most other bimolecular reactions *don't* require a third body, despite the same conservation laws applying to all collisions.

**You should be able to:** Explain why a termolecular collision is implausible for the NO oxidation reaction, write a pre-equilibrium mechanism that reproduces the observed third-order rate law, and explain why ozone formation requires a third body.

## Key Concepts

- The **Lindemann–Hinshelwood mechanism** resolves the unimolecular reaction paradox: activation occurs by collision (Step 1), but at high pressures the excitation–deactivation equilibrium is fast, making only the slow unimolecular decomposition visible.
- Applying the SSA to A* gives the Lindemann rate law, $\nu = k_1 k_2[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{M}]/(k_{-1}[\mathrm{M}] + k_2)$, which predicts a **transition from first-order to second-order** kinetics as the pressure decreases.
- Third-order rate laws do not imply termolecular collisions. Pre-equilibrium mechanisms involving two sequential bimolecular steps can produce apparent third-order kinetics.
- The **negative temperature dependence** of the NO oxidation arises because the pre-equilibrium constant $K$ decreases with temperature faster than $k_2$ increases.
- Highly exothermic association reactions often require a **third body** to carry away excess energy from a vibrationally excited intermediate. Without this energy transfer, the product dissociates back to reactants.
- The SSA and pre-equilibrium approximation, developed in Lectures 4 and 5, are essential tools for understanding real reaction mechanisms — from gas-phase decomposition to atmospheric chemistry.
