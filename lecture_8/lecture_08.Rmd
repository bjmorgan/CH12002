# Binding and Catalysis

The Lindemann mechanism showed how the SSA can explain pressure-dependent kinetics for gas-phase reactions. In this chapter, we apply the same mathematical framework to a very different setting: the kinetics of *binding*. When a substrate binds to an enzyme, or a gas molecule adsorbs onto a surface, the resulting kinetics share a common mathematical structure — saturation kinetics — that arises from the competition between binding and reaction at a finite number of sites.

## Enzyme Kinetics {#sec:enzyme-kinetics}

Enzymes are biological catalysts — predominantly proteins — that dramatically accelerate reaction rates by lowering activation energies. Their three-dimensional structures create **active sites**: specific binding pockets where substrate molecules bind and undergo transformation into products. This specificity gives enzymes their remarkable selectivity, often catalysing just one reaction among many possibilities.

### The Michaelis–Menten Mechanism

The basic kinetic model for enzyme catalysis was proposed by Victor Henri and refined by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. The enzyme E binds reversibly to its substrate S, forming an enzyme–substrate complex ES, which then converts irreversibly to product P and regenerates the free enzyme:

$$\mathrm{E} + \mathrm{S} \underset{k_{-1}}{\stackrel{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{ES} \xrightarrow{k_\mathrm{cat}} \mathrm{E} + \mathrm{P}$$

This gives the rate equations:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{ES}]}{\mathrm{d}t} &= k_1[\mathrm{E}][\mathrm{S}] - k_{-1}[\mathrm{ES}] - k_\mathrm{cat}[\mathrm{ES}] \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{P}]}{\mathrm{d}t} &= k_\mathrm{cat}[\mathrm{ES}]
\end{align*}

The rate of product formation depends on $[\mathrm{ES}]$, which is difficult to measure directly. We need to express it in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

### Deriving the Michaelis–Menten Equation

Applying the SSA to the enzyme–substrate complex:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{ES}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\mathrm{E}][\mathrm{S}] - (k_{-1} + k_\mathrm{cat})[\mathrm{ES}] \approx 0$$

Solving for $[\mathrm{ES}]$:

$$[\mathrm{ES}] = \frac{k_1[\mathrm{E}][\mathrm{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_\mathrm{cat}}$$

This still contains $[\mathrm{E}]$, the free enzyme concentration, which changes during the reaction. We replace it using the **enzyme conservation** condition — the total enzyme concentration $[\mathrm{E}]_0$ is constant:

$$[\mathrm{E}]_0 = [\mathrm{E}] + [\mathrm{ES}] \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad [\mathrm{E}] = [\mathrm{E}]_0 - [\mathrm{ES}]$$

Substituting and solving (the algebra is straightforward but involves several steps):

$$[\mathrm{ES}] = \frac{[\mathrm{E}]_0[\mathrm{S}]}{K_\mathrm{M} + [\mathrm{S}]}$$

where we have defined the **Michaelis constant**:

\begin{equation}
K_\mathrm{M} = \frac{k_{-1} + k_\mathrm{cat}}{k_1}
(\#eq:michaelis-constant)
\end{equation}

$K_\mathrm{M}$ has units of concentration and quantifies the affinity between enzyme and substrate. When $k_\mathrm{cat} \ll k_{-1}$, the Michaelis constant reduces to $K_\mathrm{M} \approx k_{-1}/k_1$, which is the dissociation constant of the ES complex — a low $K_\mathrm{M}$ then indicates strong binding (high affinity). In general, $K_\mathrm{M}$ also depends on how quickly ES converts to product, so its interpretation is slightly more nuanced, but the rule of thumb holds: a lower $K_\mathrm{M}$ means the enzyme binds its substrate more effectively.

The rate of product formation is then:

\begin{equation}
v = k_\mathrm{cat}[\mathrm{ES}] = \frac{k_\mathrm{cat}[\mathrm{E}]_0[\mathrm{S}]}{K_\mathrm{M} + [\mathrm{S}]} = \frac{v_\mathrm{max}[\mathrm{S}]}{K_\mathrm{M} + [\mathrm{S}]}
(\#eq:michaelis-menten)
\end{equation}

where $v_\mathrm{max} = k_\mathrm{cat}[\mathrm{E}]_0$ is the **maximum velocity** — the rate when every enzyme molecule is bound to substrate.

This is the **Michaelis–Menten equation**. It has the same mathematical form as the SSA rate laws in Lecture 5 — a quantity in the numerator divided by a sum of two terms in the denominator — and the same saturation behaviour emerges from the same competition.

### Limiting Cases

```{r michaelis-menten-curve, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Michaelis–Menten curve: reaction velocity $v$ as a function of substrate concentration $[\\mathrm{S}]$. At low $[\\mathrm{S}]$ the rate increases linearly. At high $[\\mathrm{S}]$ the rate saturates at $v_\\mathrm{max}$. The substrate concentration at which $v = v_\\mathrm{max}/2$ equals $K_\\mathrm{M}$. [Draft figure from lecture slides.]", out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_8/figures/michaelis_menten_curve.png")
```

**Low substrate ($[\mathrm{S}] \ll K_\mathrm{M}$):**

$$v \approx \frac{v_\mathrm{max}}{K_\mathrm{M}}[\mathrm{S}]$$

The rate is first order in $[\mathrm{S}]$. Most enzyme molecules are free, so doubling the substrate concentration doubles the rate of binding and hence the rate of product formation.

**High substrate ($[\mathrm{S}] \gg K_\mathrm{M}$):**

$$v \approx v_\mathrm{max}$$

The rate is zero order in $[\mathrm{S}]$ — the enzyme is **saturated**. Every enzyme molecule already has a substrate bound, so adding more substrate cannot increase the rate. This is the hallmark of saturation kinetics.

At the crossover point where $[\mathrm{S}] = K_\mathrm{M}$, substituting into the Michaelis–Menten equation gives $v = v_\mathrm{max}/2$. This provides a convenient graphical method for estimating $K_\mathrm{M}$: it is the substrate concentration at which the rate is half-maximal.

### Determining Michaelis–Menten Parameters

**Non-linear regression.** The most reliable method is to fit the Michaelis–Menten equation directly to a plot of $v$ versus $[\mathrm{S}]$ using computational least-squares fitting.

**Lineweaver–Burk plot.** Taking the reciprocal of both sides of Eqn. \@ref(eq:michaelis-menten):

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{K_\mathrm{M}}{v_\mathrm{max}} \cdot \frac{1}{[\mathrm{S}]} + \frac{1}{v_\mathrm{max}}
(\#eq:lineweaver-burk)
\end{equation}

A plot of $1/v$ versus $1/[\mathrm{S}]$ is linear, with slope $K_\mathrm{M}/v_\mathrm{max}$ and $y$-intercept $1/v_\mathrm{max}$. While historically important, the Lineweaver–Burk transformation magnifies errors at low $[\mathrm{S}]$ (where $1/[\mathrm{S}]$ is large), so modern practice favours non-linear regression when computational tools are available.

```{r lineweaver-burk, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Lineweaver–Burk (double-reciprocal) plot. A plot of $1/v$ versus $1/[\\mathrm{S}]$ gives a straight line with $y$-intercept $1/v_\\mathrm{max}$ and slope $K_\\mathrm{M}/v_\\mathrm{max}$. The $x$-intercept equals $-1/K_\\mathrm{M}$. Note that data at low $[\\mathrm{S}]$ (high $1/[\\mathrm{S}]$) carry disproportionate influence on the fit. [Draft figure from lecture slides.]", out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_8/figures/lineweaver_burk.png")
```

### Catalytic Efficiency

The **catalytic constant** $k_\mathrm{cat}$ (also called the **turnover number**) gives the maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time:

$$k_\mathrm{cat} = \frac{v_\mathrm{max}}{[\mathrm{E}]_0}$$

A more complete measure of efficiency combines binding and catalysis. The **specificity constant** $k_\mathrm{cat}/K_\mathrm{M}$ is the effective second-order rate constant for the reaction of free enzyme with free substrate at low $[\mathrm{S}]$:

$$v \approx \frac{k_\mathrm{cat}}{K_\mathrm{M}}[\mathrm{E}]_0[\mathrm{S}] \qquad \text{(when } [\mathrm{S}] \ll K_\mathrm{M}\text{)}$$

The upper limit of $k_\mathrm{cat}/K_\mathrm{M}$ is set by the rate at which enzyme and substrate molecules encounter each other by diffusion — approximately $10^{8}$–$10^{9}\,\mathrm{dm}^3\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Enzymes that approach this limit, such as catalase and carbonic anhydrase, are said to be **diffusion-limited**: every encounter leads to reaction.

## The Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm {#sec:langmuir}

Enzyme kinetics describes binding at molecular active sites in solution. A closely related problem arises in surface chemistry: how does a gas adsorb onto a solid surface?

Consider a surface with a fixed number of equivalent adsorption sites. Gas molecules A can bind to (adsorb on) empty sites, and adsorbed molecules can desorb back into the gas phase:

$$\mathrm{A(g)} + \text{site} \underset{k_\mathrm{d}}{\stackrel{k_\mathrm{a}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{A(ads)}$$

We define the **fractional surface coverage** $\theta$ as the fraction of sites that are occupied ($0 \leq \theta \leq 1$). The rate of adsorption is proportional to both the gas-phase pressure $p$ and the fraction of *empty* sites $(1 - \theta)$. The rate of desorption is proportional to the fraction of occupied sites $\theta$:

\begin{align*}
\text{Rate of adsorption} &= k_\mathrm{a}\,p\,(1 - \theta) \\
\text{Rate of desorption} &= k_\mathrm{d}\,\theta
\end{align*}

At equilibrium (or equivalently, applying the SSA to the surface coverage), these rates are equal:

$$k_\mathrm{a}\,p\,(1 - \theta) = k_\mathrm{d}\,\theta$$

Expanding and rearranging:

$$k_\mathrm{a}\,p = \theta(k_\mathrm{d} + k_\mathrm{a}\,p)$$

\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{K\,p}{1 + K\,p}
(\#eq:langmuir)
\end{equation}

where $K = k_\mathrm{a}/k_\mathrm{d}$ is the **Langmuir adsorption constant** (the ratio of the adsorption and desorption rate constants, with units of inverse pressure).

```{r langmuir-isotherm, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="The Langmuir adsorption isotherm: fractional surface coverage $\\theta$ as a function of gas pressure $p$. At low pressure, $\\theta$ increases linearly with $p$. At high pressure, the surface becomes saturated ($\\theta \\to 1$). The pressure at which $\\theta = 1/2$ equals $1/K$."}

# Need to create a new figure showing θ vs p with saturation behaviour.
knitr::include_graphics("lecture_8/figures/langmuir_isotherm.png")
```

### Limiting Cases

**Low pressure ($K\,p \ll 1$):**

$$\theta \approx K\,p$$

The coverage increases linearly with pressure. Most sites are empty, so each additional gas molecule has many available sites to bind to.

**High pressure ($K\,p \gg 1$):**

$$\theta \approx 1$$

The surface is **saturated** — virtually every site is occupied. Increasing the pressure further has no effect on the coverage, because there are no more sites available.

At $p = 1/K$, the coverage is $\theta = 1/2$. The Langmuir constant $K$ thus plays the same role as $1/K_\mathrm{M}$ in enzyme kinetics: it characterises the binding strength, and its reciprocal is the "half-saturation" value.

::: {.skill}
**You should be able to:** Derive the Langmuir adsorption isotherm $\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)$ by balancing the rates of adsorption and desorption, and describe the limiting behaviour at low and high pressure.

## The Common Pattern: Saturation Kinetics {#sec:saturation-pattern}

The Michaelis–Menten equation and the Langmuir isotherm describe very different physical systems — enzymes in solution and gases on surfaces — yet they share the same mathematical form. This is not a coincidence. Both arise from the same underlying mechanism: **reversible binding to a finite number of sites, followed by a process that competes with unbinding**.

| | Michaelis–Menten | Langmuir |
|---|---|---|
| **Binding sites** | Enzyme active sites | Surface adsorption sites |
| **Species that binds** | Substrate S | Gas molecule A |
| **Key variable** | $v/v_\mathrm{max} = [\mathrm{S}]/(K_\mathrm{M} + [\mathrm{S}])$ | $\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)$ |
| **Saturation** | All enzyme bound ($v = v_\mathrm{max}$) | All sites occupied ($\theta = 1$) |
| **Half-saturation** | $[\mathrm{S}] = K_\mathrm{M}$ | $p = 1/K$ |
| **Low-concentration limit** | First order in $[\mathrm{S}]$ | $\theta$ proportional to $p$ |
| **High-concentration limit** | Zero order in $[\mathrm{S}]$ | $\theta$ independent of $p$ |

The general pattern is: when the number of sites is limited and binding is reversible, the response (rate or coverage) increases with the concentration of the binding species but eventually saturates. This behaviour appears across chemistry and biology — from enzyme kinetics and surface catalysis to receptor–ligand binding and ion-channel gating. In surface reactions where two species compete for the same sites, this competition can lead to the counterintuitive phenomenon of *negative reaction orders*, where increasing a reactant's concentration actually slows the reaction (Appendix \@ref(appendix-negative-orders)).

## Key Concepts

- The **Michaelis–Menten equation**, $v = v_\mathrm{max}[\mathrm{S}]/(K_\mathrm{M} + [\mathrm{S}])$, is derived by applying the SSA to the enzyme–substrate complex and using the enzyme conservation condition $[\mathrm{E}]_0 = [\mathrm{E}] + [\mathrm{ES}]$.
- $K_\mathrm{M}$ is the substrate concentration at which the rate is half-maximal. It quantifies enzyme–substrate affinity: lower $K_\mathrm{M}$ means stronger binding.
- At low $[\mathrm{S}]$ the reaction is first order (most enzyme is free); at high $[\mathrm{S}]$ it is zero order (enzyme is saturated).
- The **Langmuir adsorption isotherm**, $\theta = Kp/(1 + Kp)$, describes the fractional coverage of a surface as a function of gas pressure. It is derived by balancing the rates of adsorption and desorption.
- Both equations share the same mathematical form because both describe **reversible binding to a finite number of sites** — the defining feature of saturation kinetics.
- The **specificity constant** $k_\mathrm{cat}/K_\mathrm{M}$ measures the overall catalytic efficiency of an enzyme, with an upper limit set by the diffusion-controlled encounter rate.
